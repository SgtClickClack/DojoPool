Below, I've compiled a prioritized list of suggestions for updating, improving, and fixing code snippets in your Dojo Pool repository. I've also written prompts for Model 01, making it easy for you to copy and paste them for further improvements.

1. Optimize the Player Class
Priority: High
Objective: The Player class has grown complex with many attributes and responsibilities. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
Updated Code Snippet:
python
Copy code
class Player:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.moral_alignment = MoralAlignment()
        self.visual_handler = VisualsHandler()
        self.dojo_interaction = DojoInteraction()

class MoralAlignment:
    def __init__(self):
        self.score = 0

    def adjust_score(self, choice):
        adjustments = {
            'good_action': 5,
            'bad_action': -3,
        }
        self.score += adjustments.get(choice, 0)

class VisualsHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        # Handle player visuals here
        pass

class DojoInteraction:
    def __init__(self):
        # Handle dojo-related interactions here
        pass
Prompt: "The Player class is doing too much. I've split the Player class into multiple specialized classes: MoralAlignment, VisualsHandler, and DojoInteraction. Ensure each class handles a distinct responsibility, reducing complexity in the Player class and adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle."
2. Improve Real-Time Communication Stability (Socket.IO)
Priority: High
Objective: Improve the stability and scalability of Socket.IO communications.
Updated Code Snippet:
python
Copy code
import socketio

sio = socketio.Server(reconnection=True, reconnection_attempts=5, logger=True)

@sio.event
def connect(sid, environ):
    print('Client connected', sid)

@sio.event
def disconnect(sid):
    print('Client disconnected', sid)

@sio.event
def error_handler(error):
    print(f'Error occurred: {error}')

# Use retry with exponential backoff to handle reconnects
@sio.on('message')
def handle_message(sid, data):
    try:
        # Your event handling logic here
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f'Failed to process message: {e}')
Prompt: "The real-time communication with Socket.IO in the Dojo Pool project has been improved with reconnection logic, error-handling events, and scalability improvements. Please further optimize the implementation to handle even more concurrent users effectively."
3. Update Google Text-to-Speech (TTS) Code
Priority: Medium
Objective: The Google TTS implementation could be improved for efficiency and error handling.
Updated Code Snippet:
python
Copy code
import asyncio
import time
from google.cloud import texttospeech_v1 as tts
from google.api_core.exceptions import GoogleAPICallError

async def generate_speech(text):
    client = tts.TextToSpeechAsyncClient()

    input_text = tts.SynthesisInput(text=text)
    voice = tts.VoiceSelectionParams(language_code="en-US", ssml_gender=tts.SsmlVoiceGender.NEUTRAL)
    audio_config = tts.AudioConfig(audio_encoding=tts.AudioEncoding.MP3)

    retry_attempts = 3
    for attempt in range(retry_attempts):
        try:
            response = await client.synthesize_speech(input=input_text, voice=voice, audio_config=audio_config)
            with open("output.mp3", "wb") as out:
                out.write(response.audio_content)
            break
        except GoogleAPICallError as e:
            if attempt < retry_attempts - 1:
                await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)
            else:
                raise e
Prompt: "The Google Text-to-Speech implementation now uses async and retry logic with exponential backoff. Please further refine this to improve the non-blocking nature of the code and ensure scalability."
4. Enhance Game Mechanics for Special Powers
Priority: Medium
Objective: The special powers for players need better encapsulation and should be scalable for adding more powers in the future.
Updated Code Snippet:
python
Copy code
class SpecialPower:
    def use(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("This method should be overridden by subclasses.")

class ExtraCoins(SpecialPower):
    def use(self, player):
        player.coins += 10

class VisionPower(SpecialPower):
    def use(self, player, opponent):
        print(f"{player.name} can see {opponent.name}'s moves.")

class SpecialPowerFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_special_power(power_type):
        power_types = {
            'extra_coins': ExtraCoins,
            'vision_power': VisionPower,
        }
        return power_types.get(power_type, SpecialPower)()

# Example usage
player1 = Player('Player1')
special_power = SpecialPowerFactory.get_special_power('extra_coins')
special_power.use(player1)
Prompt: "The special powers functionality has been refactored using a factory pattern. Each power is now a subclass of SpecialPower, making it easier to add new ones in the future. Please add additional power types as required."
5. Improve Moral Score Handling
Priority: Medium
Objective: The code for updating the moral score could be simplified and made more readable.
Updated Code Snippet:
python
Copy code
def make_choice(self, choice):
    score_adjustments = {
        'help_elderly': 10,
        'steal': -15,
        'donate_charity': 20,
        'lie': -5,
    }
    self.moral_score += score_adjustments.get(choice, 0)
Prompt: "The moral score logic has been simplified by using a dictionary for score adjustments. Please add error-handling to ensure invalid choices are properly logged or rejected."
6. Add Data Persistence
Priority: Medium
Objective: Add persistent storage for players' stats and progress.
Updated Code Snippet:
python
Copy code
import sqlite3

class PlayerDataPersistence:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect('dojo_pool.db')
        self.create_table()

    def create_table(self):
        self.conn.execute('''
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS players (
                id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                name TEXT NOT NULL,
                coins INTEGER,
                moral_alignment INTEGER
            )
        ''')

    def save_player(self, player):
        with self.conn:
            self.conn.execute('INSERT INTO players (name, coins, moral_alignment) VALUES (?, ?, ?)', 
                              (player.name, player.coins, player.moral_alignment))

    def load_player(self, name):
        cursor = self.conn.cursor()
        cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM players WHERE name = ?', (name,))
        return cursor.fetchone()
Prompt: "Persistent storage has been added using SQLite to save player data. Please add retrieval methods for more attributes like dojo visits and ensure thread safety for concurrent reads and writes."
7. Fix Hardcoded HTML in Flask Templates
Priority: Low
Objective: Improve maintainability by avoiding hardcoded HTML.
Updated Code Snippet:
html
Copy code
<!-- base.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>{{ title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
    {% block content %}
    {% endblock %}
</body>
</html>

<!-- index.html -->
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block content %}
<h1>Welcome, {{ player_name }}!</h1>
<p>Your current coins: {{ coins }}</p>
<a href="{{ url_for('play') }}">Start Playing!</a>
{% endblock %}
Prompt: "The HTML templates have been converted to use Jinja2 templates, making them reusable. Please review the templates to add further improvements for more dynamic content as needed."
8. Implement Logging Improvements
Priority: Low
Objective: The logging could be made more descriptive and useful for debugging.
Updated Code Snippet:
python
Copy code
import logging

logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("dojo_pool.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def some_function():
    try:
        # Some code logic
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"An error occurred in some_function: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
Prompt: "Enhance the logging system to include contextual information such as user-specific actions and to capture errors more thoroughly."
