It seems the Google OAuth configuration issues are persisting, specifically with the Error 401: invalid_client and redirect loops. Here’s a structured approach to address these issues and ensure everything is set up correctly:

1. Review OAuth Client Configuration in Google Cloud Console
Confirm Client ID and Secret: Double-check that the Client ID and Client Secret in your code match the credentials set up in your Google Cloud Console. A mismatch here will lead to the "invalid_client" error.
Redirect URI: Ensure that the Authorized redirect URI matches exactly, including HTTPS, without trailing slashes. Use the exact Replit URL or the production domain, dojopool.com.au, for production deployment.
JavaScript Origins: Confirm that the Authorized JavaScript Origins include your app’s domain (e.g., https://dojopool.com.au) and any Replit preview URLs you’re using.
2. Clear Redirect Loop on Replit
Redirect URI Conflicts: Verify that the callback URI for OAuth (/auth/google_login/callback) is used correctly in your app's code and Google Console. Redirect loops can occur if multiple redirects are mistakenly pointing back to each other.
Clear Cookies and Cache: Redirect loops can sometimes be cached, so clearing cookies or using an incognito window for testing can help.
3. Set Up Production Domain (dojopool.com.au)
Enable HTTPS on Replit or Hosting Platform: Ensure HTTPS is active on Replit or any custom hosting platform.
Update Google OAuth: Once dojopool.com.au is live with HTTPS, add it as an Authorized domain in the Google Cloud Console under OAuth settings.
4. Testing in “Testing” Mode
Since the app is in Google’s "Testing" mode, confirm that your Google account is listed as a test user in the OAuth settings. Non-listed users won’t be able to authenticate until the app is published and verified.
5. Verify API Keys Aren't Exposed
Ensure no sensitive keys (like API keys for OpenAI or Twilio) are hard-coded into your codebase to avoid any GitHub push restrictions or security vulnerabilities. Place them in environment variables where necessary.
Once you make these adjustments, test the login flow to confirm OAuth is working without redirect issues. Let me know if you'd like more help with any step!
