# Penetration Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the penetration testing strategy for the DojoPool application. The testing will follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines and industry best practices for web application security assessment.

## Scope
- Web application (https://dojopool.com)
- API endpoints (/api/*)
- WebSocket connections
- Authentication system
- Database access
- File upload functionality
- Real-time game features

## Test Types

### 1. Reconnaissance
- Domain enumeration
- Port scanning
- Service identification
- Technology stack fingerprinting
- Public information gathering

### 2. Authentication Testing
- Brute force protection
- Password policy enforcement
- Session management
- OAuth implementation
- Token security
- 2FA implementation

### 3. Authorization Testing
- Role-based access control
- Privilege escalation
- Horizontal access control
- API endpoint permissions
- WebSocket authorization

### 4. Input Validation
- SQL injection
- XSS (reflected, stored, DOM)
- CSRF protection
- File upload validation
- JSON/XML injection
- Command injection

### 5. API Security
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Input sanitization
- Error handling
- Authentication bypass
- Data exposure

### 6. Network Security
- SSL/TLS configuration
- HTTP security headers
- CORS policy
- Subdomain takeover
- DNS security

### 7. Data Security
- Encryption implementation
- Sensitive data exposure
- Backup security
- Database security
- Cache security

### 8. Real-time Features
- WebSocket security
- Game state manipulation
- Race conditions
- Real-time data integrity
- Event injection

## Tools
1. Web Application Scanners
   - OWASP ZAP
   - Burp Suite Professional
   - Acunetix

2. Network Security
   - Nmap
   - Wireshark
   - SSLyze

3. API Testing
   - Postman
   - SoapUI
   - JMeter

4. Custom Tools
   - WebSocket security testing scripts
   - Game state manipulation tools
   - Custom fuzzing tools

## Test Environment
- Staging environment mirror
- Isolated test database
- Test user accounts
- Monitoring tools enabled
- Logging enhanced

## Test Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment (Days 1-2)
- Environment setup
- Reconnaissance
- Surface area mapping
- Risk assessment

### Phase 2: Automated Scanning (Days 3-4)
- Vulnerability scanners
- Automated tools
- Configuration analysis
- Baseline security assessment

### Phase 3: Manual Testing (Days 5-8)
- Authentication testing
- Authorization testing
- Input validation
- Business logic testing
- Custom exploit attempts

### Phase 4: Real-time Feature Testing (Days 9-10)
- WebSocket security
- Game manipulation attempts
- Race condition testing
- Real-time data integrity

### Phase 5: Reporting (Days 11-12)
- Findings documentation
- Risk assessment
- Remediation recommendations
- Executive summary

## Deliverables
1. Test Results
   - Vulnerability report
   - Risk assessment matrix
   - Evidence and proof of concepts
   - Attack narratives

2. Recommendations
   - Remediation steps
   - Priority matrix
   - Timeline suggestions
   - Best practices

3. Documentation
   - Test coverage report
   - Tool configurations
   - Test cases
   - Retest guidelines

## Security Considerations
- All tests must be conducted in the staging environment
- No destructive testing without explicit approval
- Data must be sanitized after testing
- Findings must be reported immediately
- Credentials must be rotated after testing

## Team
- Lead Penetration Tester
- Application Security Engineer
- Network Security Specialist
- API Security Expert
- Development Team Lead (consultation)

## Communication
- Daily status updates
- Immediate notification of critical findings
- Weekly summary reports
- Final presentation

## Timeline
- Total duration: 12 working days
- Start date: TBD
- End date: TBD
- Review period: 3 days

## Success Criteria
1. Complete coverage of all test types
2. Documentation of all findings
3. Actionable remediation steps
4. No disruption to production
5. Clear risk assessment
