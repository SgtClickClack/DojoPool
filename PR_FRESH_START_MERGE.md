##  **Major Refactoring and Clean Slate**

This PR introduces a fresh start for the DojoPool project, resolving critical git history issues with large files while preserving essential refactoring work.

### **What This PR Accomplishes:**
 **Resolves Git History Issues**: Eliminates the problematic dojopool.bundle file (406.66 MB) that was blocking all pushes  
 **Fresh Repository Foundation**: Creates a clean, professional git history for future development  
 **Preserves Refactoring Work**: Maintains all the critical tournament system improvements  

### **Core Changes:**
- **Consolidated Tournament Types**: Unified interface definitions with consistent naming conventions
- **Advanced TournamentBracket Component**: Multi-format support (Single/Double Elimination, Round Robin, Swiss)
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper TypeScript support and separation of concerns
- **Professional Documentation**: Comprehensive README and project structure

### **Technical Benefits:**
- Clean git history without large file artifacts
- Proper .gitignore to prevent future issues
- Type-safe tournament system implementation
- Modern component architecture with Material-UI

### **Files Added:**
- src/types/tournament.ts - Consolidated tournament interfaces
- src/components/Tournament/TournamentBracket.tsx - Advanced bracket visualization
- .gitignore - Comprehensive file exclusion rules
- README.md - Professional project documentation

### **Why This Approach:**
The original repository had a large file (dojopool.bundle) deeply embedded in the git history since July, making conventional git operations impossible. This fresh start approach provides:
- Immediate resolution of blocking issues
- Professional foundation for collaboration
- Clean history for future contributors
- Preserved essential development work

### **Next Steps After Merge:**
1. Set resh-start as the new development standard
2. Continue development on the clean foundation
3. Archive or clean up the problematic original branches

**Note**: This represents a strategic decision to prioritize project stability and professional development practices over preserving problematic git history.
