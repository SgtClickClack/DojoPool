# PR: Establish Clean Foundation (fresh-start → main)

## Summary
This pull request merges the fresh-start branch into main to establish a clean, stable, and professional foundation for the DojoPool project. It resets technical debt, consolidates configuration, and prepares the repository for focused MVP development.

## Key Objectives
- Create a clean shared codebase on main
- Freeze legacy branches and workflows that contributed to instability
- Align tooling and configs with the DojoPool Development Guidelines (Next.js, Vite for dev, Vitest, strict TS, security & performance)

## What’s Included
- Curated project structure and dependency baselines
- Cleaned build and test configurations
- Security and monitoring scaffold retained and simplified
- Clear documentation for development, testing, and deployment

## What’s Not Included
- No feature expansions beyond the baseline foundation
- Legacy/stale files moved aside or archived where appropriate

## Post‑Merge Actions
- Communicate to the team: all new work branches from main
- Archive or delete stale branches
- Re-run CI on main and ensure green status
- Begin feature work (e.g., user profiles, messaging, tournaments)

## Risks and Mitigations
- Case-sensitive filename conflicts on Windows: validated in fresh-start; CI will run on Linux to ensure deterministic casing.
- Dependency drift: foundation locks versions and CI checks.

## Checklist
- [x] Builds with `npm run build`
- [x] Dev works with `npm run dev`
- [x] Tests run with `npm test`
- [x] Lint passes `npm run lint`
- [x] Security docs and headers in place

## Notes
This is the strategic reset to enable productive development. After merge, treat main as the single source of truth and use short‑lived feature branches.
