# Dependency Resolution Summary

## Issue Description

The project was experiencing dependency conflicts that prevented successful installation of npm packages. The main issues were:

1. `@react-three/drei@10.6.0` required React 19, but the project was using React 18.2.0
2. `@chakra-ui/toast@2.0.0` required `@chakra-ui/system@2.0.0`, but the project was using `@chakra-ui/system@2.6.2`
3. Additional dependency conflicts were discovered during resolution

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to the `package.json` file to resolve the dependency conflicts:

1. Downgraded `@react-three/drei` from 10.6.0 to 9.88.0 to be compatible with React 18.2.0
2. Upgraded `@chakra-ui/toast` from 2.0.0 to 7.0.2 to be compatible with `@chakra-ui/system@2.6.2`
3. Downgraded `@react-three/fiber` from 9.2.0 to 8.15.19 to be compatible with React 18.2.0
4. Downgraded `react-konva` from 19.0.6 to 18.2.10 to be compatible with React 18.2.0
5. Downgraded `three` from 0.178.0 to 0.150.1 to be compatible with `@react-three/drei@9.88.0`

## Results

- The npm installation now completes successfully without dependency conflicts
- There are some warnings about peer dependencies, but these don't prevent installation
- There are 2 high severity vulnerabilities that could be addressed with `npm audit fix --force`
- The build process encounters an error related to Node.js built-in modules being used in a browser context, which is unrelated to the dependency conflicts and would require additional changes to the project's code or build configuration

## Next Steps

1. Consider running `npm audit fix --force` to address the security vulnerabilities
2. Address the build error related to the 'events' module being used in a browser context, which may require:
   - Using a browser-compatible alternative to Node.js's EventEmitter
   - Configuring Vite to properly handle Node.js built-in modules
   - Refactoring the code to avoid using Node.js-specific modules in browser code

## Conclusion

The dependency conflicts in the package.json file have been successfully resolved, allowing the project to install its dependencies without errors. Additional work may be needed to address build issues, but those are separate from the dependency conflict resolution.
