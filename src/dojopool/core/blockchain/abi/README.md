# ABI Directory

This directory contains placeholder ABI JSON files for bridge contracts (Hop, Across, Connext).

- These ABIs are minimal and only allow the test suite to run without errors.
- For production or integration with real contracts, replace these files with the actual ABI JSONs from the deployed contracts.

## Files
- `hop_bridge.json`: Placeholder for Hop bridge contract ABI
- `across_bridge.json`: Placeholder for Across bridge contract ABI
- `connext_bridge.json`: Placeholder for Connext bridge contract ABI

**Note:** If you add new bridge protocols or networks, add their ABI files here as well.
