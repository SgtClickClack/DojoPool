## Tasks for a Professional & Deployable Application

### Code Quality and Consistency
- [ ] Systematically fix syntax errors as reported by Black/flake8.
- [ ] Increase static typing: add type annotations and ensure MyPy passes without spurious warnings.

### Testing & CI/CD
- [ ] Integrate automated testing using pytest (create a basic test suite covering core functionalities).
- [ ] Set up a Continuous Integration pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) to run tests, linters, and type checks automatically on commits.

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Centralize configuration management using a library (e.g., python-decouple) for handling environment variables and default values.

### Deployment & Containerization
- [ ] Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
- [ ] Set up Docker Compose for multi-service setups if needed.
- [ ] Evaluate production WSGI server options (Waitress vs Gunicorn/uWSGI) and document the best deployment strategy.

### Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Implement structured logging (consider JSON logging for easier aggregation).
- [ ] Integrate application monitoring and error tracking (e.g., Prometheus, New Relic, or similar tools).

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README with comprehensive setup, configuration, testing, and deployment instructions.
- [ ] Create API and developer documentation to guide future development and maintenance.

## Reorganize Project Structure

- [ ] **Move Core Code to `src/` Directory**  
  - Create a dedicated `src/` directory (if not already present) and move all the core application code (e.g., `dojopool/` package) into it.
  
- [ ] **Update Import Paths**  
  - Update all import statements across the codebase to reference modules relative to the new package root (e.g., use `from dojopool import monitor_basic` instead of `from src.dojopool import monitor_basic`).

- [ ] **Adjust Configuration Settings**  
  - Update configuration files (e.g., `mypy.ini`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) to reflect the new directory structure, ensuring that tools like MyPy only reference the `src/` folder.

- [ ] **Reconfigure Environment Variables**  
  - Ensure that environment variables such as `PYTHONPATH` are set (or unset) appropriately so that duplicate module discovery is avoided.

- [ ] **Run Tests & Validate Changes**  
  - Re-run MyPy and any test suites to confirm that the reorganization has resolved the duplicate module issues and that everything functions as expected.

## Gradually Remove Mypy Suppressions
- [ ] **Improve Typing in dojopool.services Modules**
  - Remove `ignore_errors` in [mypy-dojopool.services.*] after adding proper annotations.
- [ ] **Improve Typing in dojopool.routes and API Modules**
  - Remove suppressions in [mypy-dojopool.routes.*] and [mypy-dojopool.api.*] after each module is properly typed.
