# Development Tracking - DojoPool Project

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Integrated the MCP tool for dynamic narrative asset generation.
- [x] Developed and deployed NarrativeService along with narrative API endpoint.
- [x] Configured the testing environment using Jest, ts-node, and ambient module declarations for @jest/types.
- [x] Updated package.json and tsconfig.json accordingly to support our development workflow.
- [x] Implemented a basic Three.js interactive 3D prototype.
- [x] Developed a Pool Physics prototype integrating cannon-es for basic physics simulation.
- [x] Enhanced the Pool Physics prototype by adding a realistic pool table and multiple pool balls.
- [x] Advanced Pool Environment Prototype: Added table borders and pockets.
- [x] **Refined Advanced Pool Environment:** Improved collision responses using custom physics materials and contact materials.
- [x] **Real-Time Notifications Integration:** Added a real-time notifications component using Pusher.

## Time Spent
- **MCP Integration & NarrativeService:** ~15 hours
- **Testing Framework Setup (Jest/ts-node):** ~8 hours
- **Interactive 3D Prototype (Three.js):** ~4 hours
- **Pool Physics Prototype (Three.js + cannon-es):** ~4 hours
- **Enhanced Pool Physics Prototype:** ~5 hours
- **Advanced Pool Environment Prototype:** ~5 hours
- **Refined Collision & Physics Tuning:** ~4 hours
- **Real-Time Notifications Integration:** ~3 hours

## New Tasks / Next Steps
- **Interactive 3D Visuals Enhancements:**
  - [ ] Further refine collision responses and tune friction/restitution for even smoother ball interactions.
- **Real-Time Communication Enhancements:**
  - [ ] Evaluate further integration options with WebRTC for peer-to-peer interactions.
- **AR & Computer Vision Integration:**
  - Explore implementation of OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, and AR.js.
- **Advanced End-to-End Testing:**
  - Investigate and set up a trial run with Cypress or Playwright.
- **Analytics & Engagement:**
  - Plan integration of tools like Mixpanel, Amplitude, and Google Analytics, plus push notifications (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging).
- **MCP Tool Enhancements:**
  - Iteratively refine dynamic asset generation with evolving narrative elements.

## Issues/Considerations
- Monitor performance impact from additional physics computations.
- Ensure that tuning parameters result in realistic pool interactions.
- Ensure that adding real-time features does not compromise the simulation performance.
- Verify the proper configuration and secure handling of third-party credentials.

## Next Highest-Priority Step
- **Test the Real-Time Notifications Prototype:**
  - Run the Next.js development server.
  - Navigate to `/real-time` to verify real-time events are received and displayed.
- **Test the Refined Pool Environment Prototype:**  
  Run your Next.js development server, navigate to `/refined-pool`, and verify that collision responses and ball interactions feel realistic.
