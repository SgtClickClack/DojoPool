# Dojo Pool Security Audit Report

**Date:** September 7, 2025
**Auditor:** AI Security Assessment
**Scope:** Complete application security review
**Status:** COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT COMPLETED

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive security audit of the Dojo Pool application has been completed. The application demonstrates **strong security fundamentals** with proper authentication, authorization, input validation, and security headers. However, several **critical issues** were identified that require immediate attention before production deployment.

## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. **CRITICAL: Test Endpoint Exposed in Production**

- **File:** `production-backend.js` (lines 82-93)
- **Issue:** `/api/test` endpoint is exposed in production code
- **Risk:** HIGH - Could expose system information and serve as attack vector
- **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential system reconnaissance
- **Recommendation:** Remove or protect with authentication

### 2. **HIGH: Missing Dependency Vulnerability Scan**

- **Issue:** Unable to run `yarn audit` due to missing lockfiles
- **Risk:** HIGH - Unknown vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Impact:** Potential exploitation of known vulnerabilities
- **Recommendation:** Generate lockfiles and run comprehensive vulnerability scan

### 3. **MEDIUM: Environment Variable Exposure Risk**

- **Files:** Multiple `.env` files with sensitive data
- **Issue:** Production secrets visible in configuration files
- **Risk:** MEDIUM - Potential credential exposure
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services
- **Recommendation:** Implement proper secret management

## ‚úÖ SECURITY STRENGTHS

- **Refresh Token Security:** SHA-256 hashed blocklist implementation
- **Google OAuth:** Properly implemented with fallback handling
- **Password Requirements:** bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds

#### ‚úÖ API Endpoint Security

- **Input Validation:** All endpoints use DTOs with class-validator
- **Authorization:** JWT guards properly implemented
- **Rate Limiting:** Comprehensive rate limiting strategy
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error responses without information leakage

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas of Concern

- **Metrics Endpoint:** Exposes system information (memory, CPU usage)
- **Health Check:** Reveals environment and service status
- **Admin Endpoints:** Properly protected but should be monitored

### Frontend Security Assessment

#### ‚úÖ Next.js Security Configuration

- **Security Headers:** Comprehensive security header configuration
- **CSP:** Properly configured for production and development
- **Image Security:** SVG content security policy implemented
- **Build Security:** Console removal in production builds

#### ‚úÖ Content Security Policy

```javascript
// Production CSP
"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://maps.googleapis.com;
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
img-src 'self' blob: data: https:;
connect-src 'self' https://vitals.vercel-insights.com https://maps.googleapis.com;
frame-ancestors 'none';"
```

### Environment & Configuration Security

#### ‚úÖ Environment Validation

- **Startup Validation:** Comprehensive environment variable validation
- **Production Checks:** Separate validation for production requirements
- **Feature Flags:** Proper handling of development vs production flags

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Issues

- **Secret Management:** Sensitive data in configuration files
- **Default Values:** Some insecure defaults in development configs

## üìä VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

### Dependency Security

- **Status:** Unable to assess due to missing lockfiles
- **Risk:** Unknown vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Action Required:** Generate lockfiles and run audit

### Known Vulnerabilities

- **Critical:** 0 identified (pending dependency scan)
- **High:** 0 identified (pending dependency scan)
- **Medium:** 0 identified (pending dependency scan)
- **Low:** 0 identified (pending dependency scan)

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Critical Priority)

1. **Remove Test Endpoints**

   ```bash
   # Remove or secure the /api/test endpoint in production-backend.js
   # Add authentication or remove entirely
   ```

2. **Generate Lockfiles and Run Vulnerability Scan**

   ```bash
   cd apps/web && yarn install --frozen-lockfile
   cd services/api && yarn install --frozen-lockfile
   yarn audit --level moderate
   ```

3. **Implement Secret Management**
   - Move sensitive data to secure secret management system
   - Use environment-specific configuration files
   - Implement secret rotation policies

### High Priority Actions

4. **Secure Metrics Endpoint**
   - Add authentication to `/api/metrics`
   - Limit exposed system information
   - Implement access logging

5. **Enhance Monitoring**
   - Implement security event logging
