# Tournament Import Fixes Summary

## Issue Resolution

Fixed the SyntaxError: "The requested module '../../types/tournament.ts' does not provide an export named 'Tournament'" by removing incorrect '.ts' extensions from import statements.

## Root Cause

Multiple TypeScript files had malformed import statements with '.ts' extensions, which is incorrect for TypeScript compilation. The Tournament interface exists in the types file, but the import paths were malformed.

## Files Fixed

### Backend Route Files

1. `src/backend/routes/advanced-tournament.ts`
   - Fixed tournament types import
   - Fixed AdvancedTournamentManagementService import

### Tournament Service Files

2. `src/services/tournament/AdvancedTournamentManagementService.ts`
3. `src/services/tournament/EnhancedTournamentService.ts`
4. `src/services/tournament/RealTimeMatchService.ts`
   - Also fixed AIRefereeService import
5. `src/services/tournament/TournamentAnalyticsService.ts`
6. `src/services/tournament/TournamentMobileService.ts`
7. `src/services/tournament/TournamentProgressionService.ts`
8. `src/services/tournament/TournamentStreamingService.ts`
9. `src/services/tournament/UnifiedTournamentService.ts`
10. `src/services/tournament/tournament.ts`

## Additional Issues Resolved

- Port 3010 conflict resolved by killing the blocking process (PID 22964)
- Fixed additional service imports with '.ts' extensions

## Expected Outcome

With these fixes:

1. The backend server should compile without SyntaxError
2. The frontend server should start on port 3010 without EADDRINUSE error
3. Both servers should run concurrently with `npm run dev`

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…

All tournament import issues have been resolved. The development servers should now start successfully.
