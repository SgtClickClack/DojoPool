# ai-docs

This folder contains all documentation related to DojoPool's AI systems, including architecture, prompt management, and integration guides. Use this folder to store and update any information that helps AI coding assistants and developers understand and extend the platform's AI features.

## Purpose

- **Persistent AI Agent Memory:** This folder acts as a knowledge base for your AI coding tools. Store third-party API docs, integration details, custom patterns, conventions, and implementation notes here.
- **Agentic Coding Pattern:** This folder is part of the agentic coding structure (see [IndyDevDan video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGg3nWp7afg)), designed to help AI coding assistants quickly understand and work with your project.

## Best Practices

- Keep documentation up to date and cross-reference with `/specs` (plans) and `/.claude` (prompts) folders.
- Add new integration notes, API docs, and conventions as the codebase evolves.
- Use clear, descriptive filenames for each document.
- Remove outdated or redundant docs regularly.
- Link to relevant specs and prompts for maximum context reuse.

## Folder Relationships

- `ai-docs/`: Persistent knowledge base for AI/agentic tools
- `specs/`: Feature plans and agentic coding specs
- `.claude/`: Reusable prompts and context priming scripts

For best results, keep this documentation up to date and cross-reference with `/specs` and `/.claude` folders.
