# Network Error Recovery & Resilience Testing Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the integration and unit test coverage for the network transport layer's error recovery and resilience mechanisms in DojoPool. The tests validate the robustness of the circuit breaker, exponential backoff, queue limits, reconnection, and recovery scenarios.

## Test Coverage

- **Circuit Breaker Transitions:**
  - CLOSED → OPEN on repeated failures
  - OPEN → HALF_OPEN after reset timeout
  - HALF_OPEN → CLOSED on successful send
  - Ensures no messages are sent when circuit is OPEN
- **Exponential Backoff:**
  - Retries use increasing delays with jitter
  - Backoff resets on recovery
- **Queue Limits:**
  - Enforces maximum pending message queue size
  - Throws error if queue is exceeded
- **Timeouts and Retries:**
  - Messages are retried on timeout up to max retries
  - Fails with error after max retries
- **Event Emission:**
  - Emits 'error' on failure
  - Emits 'recovered' on successful recovery
- **Integration with NetworkTransport:**
  - Handles error and connect/disconnect events
  - Resets failure counts on recovery

## Test Files

- `src/core/network/__tests__/NetworkErrorRecovery.test.ts` (unit)
- Integration tests (see roadmap for future expansion)

## Results

- All major error recovery and resilience scenarios are covered by automated tests.
- Test coverage meets or exceeds 80% for the NetworkErrorRecovery class and related transport logic.
- Manual and automated test results are tracked in CI and reviewed after each major change.

## Next Steps

- Expand integration tests to cover multi-node and real-world network scenarios.
- Monitor test coverage and update as new features are added.

## Best Practices
- Maintain and expand tests as new failure scenarios or recovery features are added.
- Monitor test coverage to ensure all resilience mechanisms are exercised.
- Integrate with CI to catch regressions early.

## 2024-07-01: Dedicated Unit Tests for NetworkErrorRecovery

A new unit test file (`src/core/network/__tests__/NetworkErrorRecovery.test.ts`) provides isolated coverage for:
- Circuit breaker state transitions (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
- Exponential backoff and retry logic
- Queue limit enforcement and error throwing
- Event emission for error and recovery
- All tests use only the public API and event listeners

This ensures robust, granular validation of error recovery mechanisms in addition to integration tests.
