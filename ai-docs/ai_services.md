# AI Services Integration & Performance

## Usage Example
```python
from dojopool.core.services.performance_prediction import PerformancePredictor

predictor = PerformancePredictor()
results = await predictor.predict_performance(
    player_data=player_data,
    timeframe="6m",
    comparison_group="similar_skill"
)
```

## Prediction Components
- Skill metrics
- Progression metrics
- Future skill development
- Training recommendations
- Performance milestones

## Timeline Generation
- Weekly training plans
- Progressive difficulty
- Milestone tracking
- Adaptation points

## Model Training and Updates
- Shot videos for pose estimation
- Game recordings for pattern analysis
- Player performance history
- Training session data
- Semantic versioning for models
- Model registry and backward compatibility
- Performance metrics tracking
- Calibration and regular recalibration

## Integration Guidelines
### Frontend
```javascript
// Real-time shot analysis
const analyzer = new ShotAnalyzer();
analyzer.onFrame(frame => {
    const feedback = await analyzer.analyzeShotFrame(frame);
    updateUI(feedback);
});

// Game analysis dashboard
const gameAnalyzer = new GameAnalyzer();
gameAnalyzer.onGameComplete(game => {
    const analysis = await gameAnalyzer.analyzeGame(game);
    updateDashboard(analysis);
});
```
### Backend
```python
# Shot analysis webhook
@app.post("/api/shot-analysis")
async def analyze_shot(video: UploadFile):
    analyzer = ShotAnalyzer()
    results = await analyzer.analyze_shot(video.file)
    return results

# Game analysis background task
@app.post("/api/game-analysis")
async def analyze_game(game_id: str):
    analyzer = GameAnalyzer()
    results = await analyzer.analyze_game(
        await get_game_data(game_id)
    )
    await store_analysis(game_id, results)
```

## Performance Considerations
- Real-time processing (<100ms/frame for shots, <1s for game updates)
- GPU recommended, 4GB+ RAM, SSD storage
- Model quantization, batch processing, caching, edge computing

## Error Handling
- Automatic quality enhancement
- Interpolation for missing data
- Fallback to simpler models
- Graceful degradation
- Error feedback to users

## Security Considerations
- Personal data encryption
- Secure model storage
- Access control and audit logging
- Input validation, output sanitization, rate limiting, version control

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Model accuracy, latency, resource utilization, error rates
- Regular retraining, data pipeline updates, performance optimization, security updates

## Future Developments
- 3D shot analysis, team dynamics, tournament predictions, VR integration
- Advanced biomechanics, multi-player analysis, real-time coaching, automated training plans
