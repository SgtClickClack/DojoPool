# DojoPool Development Track â€“ Backend Game Flow to Completion

## Current Status
- Health check endpoints are working and robust.
- Tournament/game API endpoints are scaffolded, registered, and fully functional.
- Backend API is now robust, reliable, and ready for frontend integration.

## Backend Progress
- [x] Scaffold Flask blueprint and endpoints for tournaments and matches
- [x] Register blueprint in Flask app
- [x] Add validation to endpoints (required fields, error handling)
- [x] Implement join tournament logic (add user to participants)
- [x] Implement match result submission logic (update status, score, winner/loser)
- [x] Add endpoints for starting and advancing tournaments, including match scheduling and round progression
- [x] Add robust error handling and global error handler for all tournament/match endpoints
- [x] Document all API endpoints and flows in `api_reference.md`
- [x] Ensure all models have `.to_dict()` for JSON responses
- [x] Test endpoints for stability and edge cases
- [x] Backend is now robust, reliable, and ready for frontend integration

## Next Steps (Frontend Integration)
- [x] Connect React/TypeScript frontend to all documented API endpoints
- [x] Implement tournament/match/game flow UI (create, join, play, report results, advance rounds)
- [x] Add error messages and loading states in UI
- [x] Test end-to-end flow from user perspective
- [x] Integrate tournament detail API to return participants and matches for each tournament
- [x] Display participant list in TournamentDetail (with status chips and "(You)" badge)
- [x] Add "Join Tournament" button to TournamentDetail for eligible users
- [x] Show real-time feedback (loading, error, success) for joining tournaments
- [x] Improve matches display: show player names, highlight current user, status/winner chips, and clear score display

## Game Logic
- [x] Backend logic to advance tournament rounds
- [x] Update standings, handle match completion, declare winner
- [ ] (Optional) Add real-time notifications or WebSocket updates for live game state

## UI/UX & CSS
- [x] Polish UI/UX for tournament detail and participant/match display
- [ ] Responsive layout for desktop/mobile
- [ ] Theming and branding for DojoPool

## Completion Criteria
- End-to-end tournament/game flow is functional for users
- All endpoints are robust, validated, and secure
- Frontend is visually appealing and user-friendly
- Ready for MVP demo or production deployment
