Code Snippet:

python
Copy code
# moral_alignment.py
class MoralAlignment:
    def __init__(self, alignment_score=0):
        self.alignment_score = alignment_score  # Range from -100 (Evil) to 100 (Heroic)

    def update_alignment(self, action_value):
        """
        Update the alignment score based on the action value.
        """
        self.alignment_score += action_value
        self.alignment_score = max(min(self.alignment_score, 100), -100)

    def get_alignment_category(self):
        """

            return 'Good'
        elif self.alignment_score >= -30:
            return 'Neutral'
        elif self.alignment_score >= -70:
            return 'Bad'
        else:
            return 'Evil'
Instructions:

Integrate with Avatar Class:

Incorporate the MoralAlignment class into your Avatar class.

Use the alignment category to determine available quests and NPC reactions.
7. Utilizing MongoDB for Data Persistence
Why MongoDB?

MongoDB is perfect for storing dynamic data like avatar states, events, and relationships in Dojo Pool.

Instructional Prompt:

Set up a MongoDB database to persist avatar data, including their moral alignment, relationships, and experiences.

Code Snippet:

python
Copy code
# db_handler.py
import os
from motor.motor_asyncio import AsyncIOMotorClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

class DBHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = AsyncIOMotorClient(os.getenv('MONGODB_URI'))
        self.db = self.client.dojo_pool

    async def save_avatar(self, avatar_data):
        """
        Save or update avatar data in the database.
        """
        await self.db.avatars.update_one(
            {'name': avatar_data['name']},
            {'$set': avatar_data},
            upsert=True
        )

    async def get_avatar(self, name):
        """
        Retrieve avatar data from the database.
        """
        return await self.db.avatars.find_one({'name': name})
Instructions:

Set Up MongoDB Database:

Use MongoDB Atlas or another MongoDB service.
Store the connection string in your .env file as MONGODB_URI.
Persist Avatar Data:

Use save_avatar() to store avatar states.
Retrieve avatars with get_avatar() when needed.
8. Implementing Neural Network for Avatar Interactions
Why a Neural Network Approach?

Modeling avatar interactions as a neural network allows for adaptive storytelling and emergent gameplay, which is central to Dojo Pool's context-driven experience.

Instructional Prompt:

Represent avatars as nodes in a graph, with interactions forming weighted edges. Use this structure to influence storylines and world events.

Code Snippet:

python
Copy code
# neural_network.py
class NeuralNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = {}  # Key: Avatar name, Value: Avatar instance
        self.edges = {}  # Key: Tuple of Avatar names, Value: Interaction weight

    def add_avatar(self, avatar):
        self.nodes[avatar.name] = avatar

    def record_interaction(self, avatar1_name, avatar2_name, weight):
        """
        Record an interaction between two avatars.
        """
        key = tuple(sorted([avatar1_name, avatar2_name]))
        self.edges[key] = self.edges.get(key, 0) + weight

    def influence_storylines(self):
        """
        Use the network to adapt storylines based on avatar interactions.
        """
        # Example logic: High-weighted connections may trigger joint quests
        pass
Instructions:

Integrate with Game Logic:

Use record_interaction() whenever avatars interact.
Implement influence_storylines() to adjust narratives based on the network state.
Visualize the Network (Optional):

Use libraries like networkx and matplotlib to visualize the interaction graph.
9. Setting Up Real-Time Communication with Socket.IO
Why Socket.IO?

Socket.IO is perfect for real-time features like live matches, spectator mode, and dynamic updates in Dojo Pool.

Instructional Prompt:

Implement real-time communication to handle live events, enabling spectators to watch matches and receive updates.

Code Snippet:

python
Copy code
# server.py
from aiohttp import web
import socketio

sio = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode='aiohttp')
app = web.Application()
sio.attach(app)

# Handle new connections
@sio.event
async def connect(sid, environ):
    print(f"Client connected: {sid}")

# Handle disconnections
@sio.event
async def disconnect(sid):
    print(f"Client disconnected: {sid}")

# Broadcast events
async def broadcast_event(event_data):
    await sio.emit('game_event', event_data)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    web.run_app(app)
Instructions:

Run the Server:

Start the server.py script to run your Socket.IO server.
Integrate with Frontend:

Use Socket.IO client libraries in your frontend to connect and receive events.
Handle Real-Time Events:

Emit events like match starts, avatar updates, and more using broadcast_event().
10. Testing and Deployment

def test_avatar_creation():
    avatar = Avatar('TestAvatar')
    assert avatar.name == 'TestAvatar'
    assert avatar.experience == 0
    assert avatar.moral_alignment == 0

def test_make_decision():
    avatar = Avatar('TestAvatar')
    decision = {'type': 'Good', 'value': 10}
    avatar.make_decision(decision)
    assert avatar.moral_alignment == 10
    assert avatar.experience == 10
Instructions:
