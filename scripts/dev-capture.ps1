<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Starts the dev server and captures all console output to a timestamped log while auto-triggering a request to reproduce a crash-on-load.

.DESCRIPTION
  This script helps diagnose issues where the dev server reports "Ready" and then crashes upon first page load.
  It will:
   1) Ensure a ./logs directory exists.
   2) Start `npm run dev` and tee all stdout/stderr to a log file.
   3) Wait until port 3000 is listening.
   4) Automatically request http://localhost:3000 to trigger the crash.
   5) Wait briefly and report the log location.

.USAGE
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\dev-capture.ps1
