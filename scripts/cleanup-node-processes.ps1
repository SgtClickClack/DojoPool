<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Safely terminates orphaned Node.js processes on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
  This script specifically targets only "node" processes and stops them.
  It checks for administrative privileges and re-launches itself elevated if needed.
  This avoids broad pattern matching that could hit protected system processes (e.g., wlanext).

.USAGE
  1) Right-click Windows PowerShell and choose "Run as administrator" (recommended), then run:
       powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\cleanup-node-processes.ps1

  2) Or just double-click/run; if not elevated, it will prompt for elevation automatically.
