# DojoPool Development Tracking

## Project Status: Mobile Video Streaming Protocol Design Phase

### Latest Update: 2025-01-30
**Mobile Video Streaming Protocol (MVSP) Design Completed**

**Core Components Implemented:**
- ✅ Comprehensive Mobile Video Streaming Protocol design document
- ✅ Hybrid WebRTC + LL-HLS architecture specification
- ✅ Mobile-specific optimization strategies
- ✅ AI Commentary integration design
- ✅ Security architecture with end-to-end encryption
- ✅ Performance metrics and monitoring framework
- ✅ Integration plan with existing DojoPool services
- ✅ Implementation roadmap with 4-phase approach

**Key Features:**
- **Protocol Design:** Hybrid multi-protocol approach combining WebRTC and LL-HLS
- **Mobile Optimization:** Battery efficiency, data usage optimization, thermal management
- **Multi-Stream Support:** Primary table view, player cameras, AI commentary, AR overlays
- **Security:** DTLS-SRTP encryption, DRM integration, anti-piracy measures
- **Quality Control:** Adaptive bitrate with battery and network awareness
- **AI Integration:** Real-time commentary with mobile edge processing
- **Performance Targets:** <1s latency, <1% packet loss, <70% CPU usage

**Integration Points:**
- Existing TournamentStreamingService extension
- TournamentMobileService integration
- RealTimeAICommentaryService mobile optimization
- WebSocket infrastructure for real-time communication
- DojoPool tournament and territory systems

**File Paths:**
- `docs/mobile-video-streaming-protocol.md` - Complete MVSP design document
- `DojoPoolCombined/DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING.md` - Updated tracking

**Next Priority Task:**
Implement Mobile Video Streaming Protocol Phase 1: Core Protocol Implementation
- Basic WebRTC mobile streaming
- Adaptive bitrate implementation  
- Battery optimization features
- Security layer implementation

Expected completion time: 4 weeks

## Previous Milestones

### 2025-01-30: Testing & Quality Assurance Phase
**ClanSystemService Test Coverage Improved**

**Core Components Implemented:**
- ✅ Testing infrastructure (Jest, pytest, Cypress)
- ✅ Python extensions module fixed (init_extensions function added)
- ✅ TypeScript/JavaScript test runner operational
- ✅ Coverage reporting system active
- ✅ SkyT1Service tests created and passing (13/13 tests)
- ✅ TerritoryGameplayService tests fixed and passing (15/15 tests)
- ✅ ClanSystemService tests fixed and passing (17/17 tests)

**Key Features:**
- **Test Coverage Baseline:** 0.79% statements, 0.65% branches, 0.81% lines, 0.66% functions
- **Test Results:** 178 total tests (134 failed, 44 passed)
- **Improved Coverage Services:**
  - SkyT1Service: 61.07% statements (13/13 tests passing)
  - TerritoryGameplayService: 100% statements (15/15 tests passing)
  - ClanSystemService: 54.82% statements (17/17 tests passing)
- **Test Infrastructure:** Jest/Vitest setup with proper mocking
- **API Mocking:** Fetch API mocking for HTTP service tests
- **Singleton Pattern:** Fixed service instantiation for singleton exports

**Integration Points:**
