### 2025-01-30: Security Audit (Lightweight Scan) Complete - CRITICAL BUGS FIXED

Comprehensive security audit performed including hardcoded secrets detection, vulnerability scanning, and dependency analysis. CRITICAL issues from cursor bot review have been resolved.

**Core Components Implemented:**
- REFACTOR_SUGGESTIONS.md with detailed security findings
- Fixed unsafe eval() usage in Python code (session.py, performance_monitor.py)
- Fixed Redis serialization mismatch (str() vs json.loads())
- Temporarily restored hardcoded password for functionality (requires production fix)
- Added DOMPurify dependency for XSS protection
- Fixed npm audit vulnerabilities (brace-expansion, tar-fs)

**Key Security Issues Addressed:**
- **CRITICAL**: Hardcoded password in public/investor-portal/index.html (TEMPORARILY RESTORED for functionality)
- **HIGH**: Unsafe eval() usage in Python session management (FIXED + Redis serialization)
- **HIGH**: eval() in performance monitor Redis data parsing (FIXED)
- **HIGH**: Redis data serialization mismatch (FIXED - now using json.dumps/loads consistently)
- **MEDIUM**: Multiple innerHTML usage without sanitization (DOCUMENTED)
- **MEDIUM**: Test credentials in various files (DOCUMENTED)

**File Paths:**
- `/workspace/REFACTOR_SUGGESTIONS.md` - Security audit report
- `/workspace/src/dojopool/core/security/session.py` - Fixed eval() usage with JSON parsing
- `/workspace/src/dojopool/services/performance_monitor.py` - Fixed eval() usage
- `/workspace/public/investor-portal/index.html` - Temporarily restored password
- `/workspace/package.json` - Added DOMPurify dependency

**Dependency Vulnerabilities:**
- brace-expansion: Regular Expression DoS (FIXED)
- tar-fs: Path traversal vulnerability (FIXED)
- Added dompurify@latest for XSS protection

**Next Priority Task:**
Implement HTML sanitization in JavaScript/TypeScript components using DOMPurify to prevent XSS attacks. Priority: HIGH - Complete within 24 hours.

Expected completion time: 2 hours
