- Offline cache populated under `.yarn/cache` (Linux/musl artifacts included)
- `.yarnrc.yml` hardened: `enableNetwork: false`, `enableGlobalCache: false`, `supportedArchitectures` set
- Docker deps stage uses `yarn install --mode=skip-build` (immutable locked by lockfile)
- API build stage runs `yarn workspace @dojopool/api prisma:generate` before build

**File Paths:**

- `.yarnrc.yml`
- `.yarn/cache/**`
- `yarn.lock`
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`

## 2025-09-16: Standardized Monorepo Dev Scripts & Startup Procedure

Established a foolproof, workspace-driven startup flow to eliminate confusion running Next.js from the monorepo root. Replaced `cd`-based scripts with Yarn workspace targets for the frontend (`dojopool-frontend`) and backend (`@dojopool/api`). This ensures `next dev` runs from `apps/web` (where the `pages/app` directories exist) and NestJS runs from `services/api` with correct env handling.

**Core Components Implemented:**

### 2025-08-29: Strategic Codebase Audit — Findings & Next Steps

Completed a comprehensive monorepo audit focusing on architecture, code quality, performance/scalability, and roadmap alignment. Identified critical mismatches (framework bootstrap, package manager usage, database provider), duplication across legacy folders, and gaps in observability, testing, and runtime configuration.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- Strategic audit report produced (architecture, code quality, performance, roadmap)
- Development tracking updated with prioritized next task
- No runtime code changes (documentation-only update)

**Key Features:**

- Monorepo structure assessment (Yarn 4 + Turbo)
- Backend framework alignment (NestJS bootstrap active)
- Database schema consistency review (Prisma consolidation needed)
- Package manager standardization (Yarn 4 enforced)
- Service architecture evaluation (Redis adapter configured)

**Integration Points:**

- API services properly wired in NestJS modules
- WebSocket Redis adapter configured for scale
- Prisma client regenerated with updated schema
- TypeScript errors reduced from 108 to 104 (4 remaining)

**File Paths:**

- DojoPoolCombined/DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING.md (this file)
- services/api/src/main.ts (NestJS bootstrap)
- services/api/src/app.module.ts (module wiring)
- packages/prisma/schema.prisma (schema updates)
- services/api/package.json (dependencies)

**Next Priority Task:**
Complete Prisma schema alignment to resolve remaining 104 TypeScript errors. The schema needs additional fields for Achievement (key, description, category), Clan (tag, dojoCoinBalance), ActivityEvent (venueId, matchId, tournamentId, clanId, updatedAt), and other models to match service expectations. This is blocking full API compilation and deployment.

Expected completion time: 2-3 hours
