### 2025-09-09: DojoPool Codebase Audit - Architectural, Performance, and Security Review

Performed a comprehensive audit of the monorepo, covering backend (NestJS + Prisma), frontend (Next.js + MUI), real-time layers (Socket.IO), caching (Redis), authentication/authorization, testing and CI, and operational hardening. Overall architecture is sound and production-grade; identified targeted improvements for security hardening, performance at scale, and maintainability.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- Backend: ValidationPipe, Helmet, rate limiting, JWT strategy, roles guard, Prisma service, Redis service, Socket.IO Redis adapter
- Realtime: Namespaced gateways for matches, tournaments, world map, notifications with room semantics
- Frontend: Next.js config with API rewrites, SSR-disabled dynamic imports for map and 3D views, analytics dashboard polling
- Testing/CI: Vitest unit/integration configs, Cypress e2e, CI workflow with Cypress and Percy
- Caching: Redis-backed cache service, decorators for read-through/write-through/invalidation
- Database: Prisma schema with normalized models for users, venues, clans, territories, matches, wallets, NFTs, achievements, telemetry

**File Paths:**

- `services/api/src/main.ts` – Security middleware, global pipes, WebSocket adapter, rate limits
- `services/api/src/auth/*` – `auth.controller.ts`, `auth.service.ts`, `jwt.strategy.ts`, `roles.guard.ts`
- `services/api/src/redis/redis.service.ts` – Pub/sub clients, Socket.IO adapter factory
- `services/api/src/cache/*` – `cache.service.ts`, `cache.decorator.ts`
- `services/api/src/prisma/prisma.service.ts`
- `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`
- `apps/web/next.config.js`; `apps/web/src/pages/*`, `apps/web/src/components/*`
- `vitest.unit.config.ts`, `vitest.integration.config.ts`, `cypress/**`, `.github/workflows/main.yml`

**Next Priority Task:**

- Security & performance hardening sprint:
  - Add token rotation with refresh token storage/blacklist in Redis; enforce one-time use and rotation on refresh
  - Strengthen CORS: fix malformed `cors.config.ts` (methods string/comma), add explicit headers and credentials
  - WebSocket auth: require JWT in handshake, validate and join user-specific rooms; rate-limit subscription events per namespace
  - Cache policy: standardize TTLs via config; add cache key namespaces and consistent invalidation for clan/territory/feed
  - DB performance: add targeted indexes for high-traffic joins (feed, matches, territories, notifications); review N+1 in services
  - Observability: add request IDs, structured logs, slow query logging, WebSocket metrics (connected, joins, emits/sec)
  - Frontend: migrate polling analytics to SSE/WebSocket where available; unify API client base paths and error boundaries

Expected completion time: 2-3 weeks

### 2025-08-29: Strategic Codebase Audit — Findings & Next Steps

Completed a comprehensive monorepo audit focusing on architecture, code quality, performance/scalability, and roadmap alignment. Identified critical mismatches (framework bootstrap, package manager usage, database provider), duplication across legacy folders, and gaps in observability, testing, and runtime configuration.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- Strategic audit report produced (architecture, code quality, performance, roadmap)
- Development tracking updated with prioritized next task
- No runtime code changes (documentation-only update)

**Key Features:**

- Monorepo structure assessment (Yarn 4 + Turbo)
- Backend framework alignment (NestJS bootstrap active)
- Database schema consistency review (Prisma consolidation needed)
- Package manager standardization (Yarn 4 enforced)
- Service architecture evaluation (Redis adapter configured)

**Integration Points:**

- API services properly wired in NestJS modules
- WebSocket Redis adapter configured for scale
- Prisma client regenerated with updated schema
- TypeScript errors reduced from 108 to 104 (4 remaining)

**File Paths:**

- DojoPoolCombined/DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING.md (this file)
- services/api/src/main.ts (NestJS bootstrap)
- services/api/src/app.module.ts (module wiring)
- packages/prisma/schema.prisma (schema updates)
- services/api/package.json (dependencies)

**Next Priority Task:**
Complete Prisma schema alignment to resolve remaining 104 TypeScript errors. The schema needs additional fields for Achievement (key, description, category), Clan (tag, dojoCoinBalance), ActivityEvent (venueId, matchId, tournamentId, clanId, updatedAt), and other models to match service expectations. This is blocking full API compilation and deployment.

Expected completion time: 2-3 hours
