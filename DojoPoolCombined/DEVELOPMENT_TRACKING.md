**🎉 DojoPool Platform Status: CORE GAME EXPERIENCE NOW VISIBLE**

The platform now properly displays the "Pool Battle Arena" game experience with player progression, story objectives, territory control, and avatar evolution. The advanced systems that were previously hidden are now integrated into the main application flow.

### 2025-07-01 (10:55 AM AEST): Phase 4 Strategic Relaunch - COMPLETE ✅

**A complete strategic review has been conducted, resulting in a fundamental pivot towards a player-centric, dynamic "Living World." The core architecture has been redesigned to support personalized player journeys starting from anywhere in the world. This document outlines the final, refined implementation plan for this new vision. All systems outlined below have been strategically approved and are ready for development.**

**Project Status: Phase 4 Implementation - PLANNING & STRATEGY COMPLETE ✅**

**Current Status: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT ✅**

The strategic vision for Phase 4 is locked. The following deep research has been conducted and the findings have been integrated into the system architecture.

**Deep Research Findings & Strategic Decisions ✅**

1. **Google Places API Data Strategy - FINALIZED**
   - Research Finding: The Google Places API place_type for billiard_hall is insufficient and will not capture the vast majority of real-world Dojos (pubs, bars with tables). Relying on this keyword search alone is not a viable strategy.
   - Strategic Decision: We will employ a "Wide Net & Community Curation" model.
     - Initial Seeding: The API will be used to search for broad categories (bar, pub, lodging, night_club) to create a database of "Unconfirmed Candidate Dojos."
     - Community Curation: Players will be empowered and incentivized to confirm these candidates or nominate new Dojos that the API missed. This approach turns a data weakness into a core community-building feature.

2. **Community-Driven Growth ("Dojo Scout Program") - FINALIZED**
   - Research Finding: Successful crowdsourcing apps (Waze, Duolingo) rely on clear incentives, status rewards, and gamified loops.
   - Strategic Decision: The "Nominate a Dojo" feature will be formalized into the "Dojo Scout Program."
     - Incentives: The first player to successfully nominate a new, valid Dojo will receive a significant reward in Dojo Coins.
     - Status: These players will also be awarded a permanent, non-tradable "Founding Scout" NFT badge to display on their profile, signifying their contribution to building the world.
     - Gamification: This turns database population into a core, rewarding gameplay mechanic for explorer-type players.

3. **Automated Venue Onboarding (Sales AI Pipeline) - FINALIZED**
   - Research Finding: Automated outreach is most effective when it is highly personalized, provides a clear value proposition, and has a low-friction call-to-action.
   - Strategic Decision: Every player nomination will trigger an automated, warm lead-generation pipeline.
     - Trigger: A new Dojo nomination with status: 'pending_community_verification' will activate the Sales AI Agent.
     - Personalization: The AI's outreach email/message will be personalized with both the venue's name and the name of the player who nominated it (e.g., "Hi Empire Hotel, your customer Julian wants you in the game!").
     - Value Proposition: The message will clearly state the benefit: "Drive real, paying customers to your venue."
     - Call-to-Action: The message will contain a single link for the venue owner to claim their free, verified Dojo profile and access the Venue Management Portal.

**Phase 4 Major Systems to be Built**

The following systems are now fully specced and represent the core work for this development phase.

🔲 **1. Dynamic Onboarding & Personalized World System**
- Description: A new, dynamic onboarding flow where each player chooses their own real-world Home Dojo. The entire game world, including progression gates and local rivalries, is then procedurally centered around their unique starting point.

🔲 **2. Dojo Hierarchy & Challenge System ("Wanderer vs. Legend")**
- Description: A robust, two-path system for player interaction with Dojos. Players can either act as "Wandering Ronin," collecting NFT badges from Dojo Masters (after defeating 2 Top Ten players + the Master), or as "Local Legends," climbing a "Top Ten" leaderboard gauntlet to claim the title of Dojo Master for their Home Dojo.

🔲 **3. Dojo Allegiance & Social System**
- Description: A "soft power" system layered on top of Dojo control. A Friend/Rival mechanic allows players to influence the "allegiance" of a Dojo, creating a dynamic social and political landscape. Dojos can be Hostile, Contested, or become Allies.

🔲 **4. Automated Lead Generation Pipeline**
- Description: The backend system that connects the "Dojo Scout Program" to the Sales AI Agent, automatically turning player nominations into warm, personalized sales leads for real-world venue owners.

**Technical Architecture - Phase 4 Additions**

**Backend Services (Express.js)**
New API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/dojo/nominate`: Creates a new Dojo with status: 'pending...' and triggers the Sales AI pipeline.
- `GET /api/dojo/candidates`: Uses Google Places API to find nearby potential Dojos for the onboarding screen.
- `POST /api/player/setHomeDojo`: Links a player to a dojo.
- `GET /api/dojo/:id/leaderboard`: Retrieves the Top Ten players for a specific Dojo.
- `POST /api/challenge/create`: Initiates a challenge (pilgrimage, gauntlet, etc.).
- `POST /api/player/relationships`: Add/update a friend or rival.

**Frontend Components (React)**
New Core Components:
- `<ChooseDojoScreen />`: The new initial screen for player onboarding.
- `<WorldHub />`: The new primary game interface, replacing the old index/dashboard. It is a map-centric view.
- `<DojoProfilePanel />`: A UI panel that displays Dojo info, leaderboards, and challenge options.
- `<PlayerRelationshipManager />`: A UI for managing friends and rivals.

**Database Integration (Prisma)**
Schema Modifications:
- Player: Add homeDojoId, unlockedZones, relationships.
- Dojo: Add venueOwnerId, status, leaderboard, allegianceMeter.
- Challenge: Create new model with type, challengerId, defenderId, outcome.
- Nomination: Create new model to track player nominations and their verification status.

**AI Integration**
Sales AI Trigger: The POST /api/dojo/nominate endpoint will be the primary integration point. On successful nomination logging, it will make an outbound API call to the Sales AI service with a structured data payload.

**File Structure (Key New Components)**
- `pages/index.tsx` -> TO BE REFACTORED to render <WorldHub />.
- `pages/onboarding/choose-dojo.tsx`: New route and component for the Home Dojo selection process.
- `src/components/world/WorldHub.tsx`: The new core map component.
- `src/components/dojo/DojoProfilePanel.tsx`: The UI for viewing a Dojo's details.
- `src/components/dojo/DojoLeaderboard.tsx`: The Top Ten list component.
- `src/services/DojoService.ts`: New frontend service for all Dojo-related API calls.
- `src/services/OnboardingService.ts`: New service to handle the player onboarding flow.

**Final Enhancements & Best Practices (Pre-Handoff) ✅**

This addendum provides an extra layer of detail on UI/UX, game feel, and technical architecture to ensure a high-quality implementation.

**1. Core Screen Wireframe Concepts**

These text-based wireframes define the layout and information hierarchy for the most critical new screens.

**Wireframe 1: pages/onboarding/choose-dojo.tsx**
The screen is split into a map view and a scrollable list of choices.

```

**2. UX/UI "Juice" & Feedback Requirements**

The "feel" of the game is critical. The agent must implement satisfying user feedback for key actions.

- **On Selecting Home Dojo**: The map should perform a rapid zoom-in animation on the chosen Dojo. The icon should satisfyingly flip from grey to blue with a subtle pulse animation and sound effect.
- **On Nominating a New Dojo**: The player should see a "Nomination Sent!" confirmation with an animated checkmark. The UI should provide immediate positive reinforcement for their contribution.
- **On Allegiance Change**: When a Dojo's allegiance shifts on the map (e.g., Rival to Ally), it should not just switch color. It should trigger a visible pulse or wave effect originating from the Dojo, alerting the player to a significant world event.

**3. Technical Architecture Best Practices**

To ensure a scalable and maintainable frontend, the following practices are strongly recommended.

- **Client State Management**: For the complex state of the WorldHub (map markers, player data, UI panel visibility, etc.), a dedicated state management library such as Zustand or Redux Toolkit should be implemented. This will prevent prop-drilling and create a single source of truth for the client-side application state.
- **Server State Management**: To handle API calls, caching, and data synchronization, a modern server-state library like React Query (TanStack Query) or SWR is critical. This will manage loading/error states, prevent redundant API calls, and improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.
