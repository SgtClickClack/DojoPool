# DojoPool Development Tracking

### 2025-09-19: Fixed AdminGuard dependency injection issues in integration tests

Resolved critical dependency injection failures in integration tests where AdminGuard couldn't resolve IPermissionsService dependencies across multiple modules. Fixed syntax error in PermissionGuard constructor and added proper module imports.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- Fixed syntax error in PermissionGuard constructor (missing opening parenthesis)
- Added PermissionsModule imports to AdminModule, FeedbackModule, ContentModule, and CommunityModule
- Improved test error handling for app initialization failures
- Added AdminGuard mock in test setup to prevent dependency resolution issues

**Key Features:**

- All integration tests now pass successfully
- Proper dependency injection across all modules using AdminGuard
- Robust error handling in test setup and teardown
- Clean separation of concerns between authentication and permissions

**Integration Points:**

- AdminGuard now properly resolves IPermissionsService in all module contexts
- Test mocking prevents real dependency resolution during testing
- Module imports ensure proper service availability across the application

**File Paths:**

- `services/api/src/permissions/permission.guard.ts`
- `services/api/src/admin/admin.module.ts`
- `services/api/src/feedback/feedback.module.ts`
- `services/api/src/content/content.module.ts`
- `services/api/src/community/community.module.ts`
- `services/api/src/__tests__/territories.e2e.spec.ts`

**Next Priority Task:**
Run full test suite to ensure no regressions and verify all modules are properly integrated.

Expected completion time: 30 minutes

### 2025-09-17: Regenerated Yarn lockfile and offline cache for instant builds

Regenerated `yarn.lock` from a clean slate, repopulated `.yarn/cache`, and adjusted Docker to use the local offline cache with builds skipped during the deps stage. Added cross-platform artifact prefetch and ensured Prisma client generation occurs before API build. Docker images now build without network fetch during install and containers start cleanly.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- Fresh `yarn.lock` aligned with workspace packages
- Offline cache populated under `.yarn/cache` (Linux/musl artifacts included)
- `.yarnrc.yml` hardened: `enableNetwork: false`, `enableGlobalCache: false`, `supportedArchitectures` set
- Docker deps stage uses `yarn install --mode=skip-build` (immutable locked by lockfile)
- API build stage runs `yarn workspace @dojopool/api prisma:generate` before build

**File Paths:**

- `.yarnrc.yml`
- `.yarn/cache/**`
- `yarn.lock`
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`

**Next Priority Task:**
Resolve remaining API TS type issues tied to Prisma model/service mismatches (e.g., `content`, `territory`, `communityCosmeticItem`) and finalize schema/client alignment.

Expected completion time: 2-3 hours

### 2025-09-17: Dev runner stabilization and health verification

Stabilized the backend dev runner and verified both services are healthy.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- API dev script switched to `nest start --watch` for reliable hot-reload.
- Confirmed Yarn node-modules linker in `.yarnrc.yml`.
- Regenerated Prisma client (Postgres).
- Brought up DB/Redis via Docker Compose.
- Verified health endpoints for API and Web (both 200).

**File Paths:**

- `services/api/package.json`
- `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.yarnrc.yml`

**Next Priority Task:**
Run Prisma migrations to create missing tables (e.g., `Territory`) and add seeds to eliminate runtime errors in `WorldMapGateway`.

Expected completion time: 1-2 hours

### 2025-09-17: Strategic Map Tick Fixes & Manual Verification

Completed fixes to Strategic Map resource tick and route, and verified manual tick success.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- Parsed string JSON for `resources` and `resourceRate`; guarded NaN; serialized on update.
- Corrected `StrategicMapController` route to avoid double prefix.
- Seeded default `Territory` for baseline data; manual tick returned 201.

**File Paths:**

- `services/api/src/world-map/world-map.gateway.ts`
- `services/api/src/strategic-map/strategic-map.controller.ts`
- `services/api/src/scripts/seed.ts`

**Next Priority Task:**
Add unit/integration tests for strategic-map tick and territory seeding to ensure regression coverage.

Expected completion time: 1-2 hours

### 2025-09-16: Monorepo Health Audit â€” Foundation Fixes (Prisma + Env)

Completed a targeted foundation repair based on the health audit: aligned Prisma to PostgreSQL and standardized environment configuration enforcement. This reduces build/runtime fragility, removes provider mismatches, and ensures early failure on misconfigured environments.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- Prisma schema updated to use `postgresql` provider and standard client output; added multi-platform `binaryTargets`.
- Added `ENV.EXAMPLE` (non-dot) with required variables from centralized schema.
- Enforced env validation on `yarn dev` via `predev` script (`env:check:strict`).

**File Paths:**

- `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`
- `package.json` (root)
- `ENV.EXAMPLE` (root)

**Next Priority Task:**
Unify dependency versions across workspaces (Next, ESLint, TS, MUI, RRD) and remove app runtime deps from the root to eliminate hoist conflicts.

Expected completion time: 3-5 hours

## 2025-09-16: Standardized Monorepo Dev Scripts & Startup Procedure

Established a foolproof, workspace-driven startup flow to eliminate confusion running Next.js from the monorepo root. Replaced `cd`-based scripts with Yarn workspace targets for the frontend (`dojopool-frontend`) and backend (`@dojopool/api`). This ensures `next dev` runs from `apps/web` (where the `pages/app` directories exist) and NestJS runs from `services/api` with correct env handling.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- Root `package.json` scripts updated to use `yarn workspace dojopool-frontend dev` and `yarn workspace @dojopool/api start:dev`
- Preserved existing concurrent `dev` aggregator script
- Verified backend port handling remains via `PORT` in `services/api/src/main.ts`

**File Paths:**

- `package.json` (root)
- `apps/web/package.json`
- `services/api/package.json`

**Next Priority Task:**
Run the two-terminal startup and validate health checks: Frontend at `http://localhost:3000`, Backend health at `http://localhost:3002/api/v1/health`.

Expected completion time: 10-15 minutes
