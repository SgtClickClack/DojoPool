- **Issue**: Backend server failing to start on designated port
- **Resolution**: Successfully started API server on port 3002 using Yarn workspace
- **Status**: API server running and accessible

### Frontend Server Startup ✅ COMPLETED

- **Issue**: Next.js frontend failing to start on designated port
- **Resolution**: Successfully started Next.js frontend on port 3011 using Yarn workspace
- **Status**: Frontend server running and accessible

### Health Endpoint Verification ✅ COMPLETED

- **Issue**: Unable to verify server health and connectivity
- **Resolution**: Confirmed API health endpoint responds correctly at `http://localhost:3002/api/v1/health`
- **Status**: Health endpoints verified and functional

### Port Conflict Resolution ✅ COMPLETED

- **Issue**: Potential port conflicts preventing server operation
- **Resolution**: Verified no port conflicts exist between services
- **Status**: All designated ports (3002, 3011) available and operational

**Key Features:**

### Environment Variables Applied:

```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3002
JWT_SECRET=dev_jwt_secret_1234567890
