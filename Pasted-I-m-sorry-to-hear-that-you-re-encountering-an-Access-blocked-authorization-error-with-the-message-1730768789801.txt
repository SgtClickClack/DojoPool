I'm sorry to hear that you're encountering an "Access blocked: authorization error" with the message "The OAuth client was not found" and error code `401: invalid_client` when trying to sign in with Google. This error typically indicates an issue with the OAuth client configuration in your application or in the Google API Console.

Let's go through the possible causes and steps to resolve this issue.

---

## Possible Causes and Solutions

### 1. Incorrect or Missing Google OAuth Client ID and Secret

**Cause:** The `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables are either missing, incorrect, or not properly set in your application.

**Solution:**

- **Verify Environment Variables:**

  - Ensure that both `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are correctly set in your environment variables.
  - Check for any leading or trailing whitespace characters that might be introduced when copying the values.

    ```python
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID", "").strip()
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET", "").strip()
    ```

- **Print the Client ID Length (Safely):**

  - You can add a debug statement to check if the client ID is being read correctly (without printing the actual value).

    ```python
    logger.debug(f"Client ID length: {len(GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID)}")
    logger.debug(f"Client Secret length: {len(GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET)}")
    ```

- **Restart Your Application:**

  - After setting or updating the environment variables, ensure that you restart your Flask application so that it picks up the new values.

### 2. Misconfigured OAuth Client in Google API Console

**Cause:** The OAuth client is not properly set up in the Google API Console, or the client ID and secret used in your application do not match the ones configured in the console.

**Solution:**

- **Verify OAuth Client Configuration:**

  1. **Access the Google API Console:**

     - Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials).

  2. **Select the Correct Project:**

     - Ensure you're working within the project that contains your OAuth 2.0 Client IDs.

  3. **Check OAuth Consent Screen:**

     - Navigate to **APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen**.
     - Ensure that the consent screen is properly configured and published.
     - Verify that your application's name, email, and scopes are correctly set.

  4. **Review OAuth 2.0 Client IDs:**

     - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
     - Under **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs**, locate your client.
     - Verify that the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** match the ones used in your application.

- **Create a New OAuth Client ID (if necessary):**

  - If you're unsure about the existing client ID, you can create a new one:

    1. Click **Create credentials > OAuth client ID**.
    2. Choose **Web application** as the application type.
    3. Set an appropriate **Name** for your client.
    4. **Authorized JavaScript origins**:

       - Add the base URL of your application (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` for local development).

    5. **Authorized redirect URIs**:

       - Add the exact redirect URI used in your application. This URI must match exactly.

         ```python
         # Example redirect URI
         http://localhost:5000/auth/callback
         ```

    6. Save the client ID and secret and update your environment variables accordingly.

### 3. Mismatch in Redirect URIs

**Cause:** The redirect URI used in your application does not match any of the authorized redirect URIs set in the Google API Console.

**Solution:**

- **Verify Redirect URIs:**

  - In your application, determine the exact redirect URI being used. It's generated by the `get_callback_url()` function.

    ```python
    def get_callback_url():
        if request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Proto') == 'https':
            scheme = 'https'
        else:
            scheme = request.scheme
        return url_for('google_auth.callback', _external=True, _scheme=scheme)
    ```

  - This typically resolves to something like `http://localhost:5000/auth/callback`.

- **Update Authorized Redirect URIs in Google API Console:**

  - In the Google API Console, ensure that the redirect URI matches exactly, including the scheme (`http` or `https`), domain, and path.
  - If your application can be accessed via multiple URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` and `https://yourdomain.com`), you need to add all possible redirect URIs.

### 4. Incorrect Client ID Usage in Code

**Cause:** There might be a mistake in how the client ID is used in your code, or the OAuth client is not properly initialized.

**Solution:**

- **Check OAuth Client Initialization:**

  - Ensure that the `WebApplicationClient` is initialized with the correct client ID.

    ```python
    client = WebApplicationClient(GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID)
    ```

- **Ensure Correct Authorization Endpoint:**

  - Verify that the authorization endpoint URL is correctly fetched from Google's discovery document.

    ```python
    google_provider_cfg["authorization_endpoint"]
    ```

- **Review the OAuth Flow:**

  - Ensure that all steps in the OAuth flow are correctly implemented and that the client ID is consistently used throughout.

### 5. Network or Firewall Issues

**Cause:** Network issues or firewall settings might be preventing your application from reaching Google's servers.

**Solution:**

- **Test Connectivity:**

  - Try accessing the Google discovery URL directly from your server to ensure that it can connect.

    ```bash
    curl https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration
    ```

- **Check Firewall Settings:**

  - Ensure that outgoing HTTPS connections to Google's servers are allowed from your application environment.

### 6. Invalid Scopes or Permissions

**Cause:** The scopes requested might be invalid or not enabled for your OAuth client.

**Solution:**

- **Review Requested Scopes:**

  - Ensure that the scopes requested in your application are valid.

    ```python
    scope=['openid', 'email', 'profile']
    ```

- **Enable Necessary APIs:**

  - In the Google API Console, ensure that the necessary APIs are enabled for your project.

    - Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
    - Enable the **Google+ API** (even though it's deprecated, some parts might still be required for certain scopes).
    - Enable the **People API** if necessary.

## Additional Tips

- **Check Application Logs:**

  - Review your application's logs for any additional error messages or stack traces that might provide more details.

- **Enable Debugging:**

  - Temporarily enable more verbose logging to help diagnose the issue.

    ```python
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    ```

- **Test with a Minimal Example:**

  - Create a minimal Flask application that implements just the OAuth flow to isolate the issue.

- **Refer to Google OAuth Documentation:**

  - Review Google's OAuth 2.0 documentation for any recent changes or updates.

    - [Using OAuth 2.0 for Web Server Applications](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server)

## Summary

The `invalid_client` error indicates that Google does not recognize the client ID provided by your application. This is often due to misconfiguration in your application or in the Google API Console. By verifying the client ID and secret, ensuring that the redirect URIs match, and double-checking your application's OAuth setup, you should be able to resolve this issue.
