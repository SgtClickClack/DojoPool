It sounds like you are running into environment issues when executing the Git configuration scripts. Let’s address each point:

### 1. **Setting Up the Python Environment:**
   - You need to ensure Python and all required packages are correctly set up to run the script.
   - If you haven’t already, install the required packages. This can be done by creating a virtual environment and using `pip install`:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     Ensure that `requirements.txt` includes necessary dependencies like GitPython and anything else used in `configure_git_auth.py` or `git_manager_consolidated.py`.

### 2. **Configuring Git Authentication:**
   - Git authentication can be a common sticking point. Here are some steps to help you configure it correctly:
     - Make sure your SSH keys are generated. If not:
       ```bash
       ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
       ```
     - Add the SSH private key to your SSH agent:
       ```bash
       eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
       ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
       ```
     - Add the SSH key to your GitHub account. Copy the public key to your clipboard:
       ```bash
       cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
       ```
       Go to your GitHub settings and add this under SSH keys.

### 3. **Executing the `git_manager_consolidated.py` Script to Clean Up the Repository:**
   - Once you have the environment and authentication set up, you can execute the script:
     ```bash
     python git_manager_consolidated.py
     ```
   - If there are specific clean-up tasks the script is meant to perform (like removing unwanted branches, organizing commits, or resetting to a clean state), make sure you have reviewed and understood its operations to avoid unintended changes.

### **Common Issues and How to Troubleshoot:**
- **Permission Denied (Publickey)**: This error indicates an issue with Git SSH authentication. Double-check the SSH key has been correctly added to GitHub and that your SSH agent is running.
- **Environment Variables**: If your script relies on certain environment variables (like GIT_USER or GIT_PASSWORD), make sure they are set:
  ```bash
  export GIT_USER="your_username"
  export GIT_PASSWORD="your_password"
  ```
  Alternatively, add them to a `.env` file and use Python's `dotenv` library to load them.

Would you like me to help craft some commands specific to executing `configure_git_auth.py`? Or perhaps go over the script contents if there's something you feel might need modification?
