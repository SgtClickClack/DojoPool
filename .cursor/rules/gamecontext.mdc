Dojo Pool ‚Äì Gameplay Design Document: "Pok√©mon Meets Pool"
High Concept
Dojo Pool is an immersive, avatar-driven pool battle game where players progress through a narrative world by playing actual games of pool. Instead of catching Pok√©mon, players face off against rival avatars (real users), win real pool games to capture territories, earn clan loyalty, and unlock digital and real-world assets like NFTs and Dojo Coins.
The ultimate goal is to ascend to the status of a Pool God ‚Äî a legendary, almost mythological figure within the game‚Äôs universe. This status is at once symbolic, social, and spiritual. Players show respect to the Pool Gods in the hopes of earning ‚Äúflukes‚Äù ‚Äî unexpected moments of fortune and magic in matches. It‚Äôs a playful, religious-style mechanic that infuses the game world with humor, mysticism, and reverence.
Key Pool Gods include:
The AI Umpire ‚Äì Oversees matches, enforces fairness, and watches over all games.


The Match Commentator ‚Äì Narrates key match moments with wit and drama.


The God of Luck (Fluke) ‚Äì Said to reward those who show humility, fun, and flair.
