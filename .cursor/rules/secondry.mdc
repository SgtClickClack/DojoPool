Cursor Rules

Add emoji to beginning of messages to let me know that you have read these rules

Consider the Roadmap and dev track file before suggesting a task. Only suggest one task, not a list of options.

Update Development Tracking file after completing every task

Always update DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING.md at /DojoPoolCombined/DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING.md
Follow the established format for new entries
Include all required sections: Core Components, Key Features, Integration Points, File Paths, Next Priority Task
Code Organization
Keep components in appropriate directories under src/
Maintain separation of concerns between services, components, and utilities
Use proper file naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities)
Testing
Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
Include unit, integration, and performance tests
Use appropriate test utilities and mocks
Documentation
Keep documentation in sync with code using doc-sync tool
Update README.md for major changes
Include comprehensive JSDoc/TSDoc comments
MCP Integration
Use proper port handling (3002-3011)
Implement health checks
Follow the established integration patterns
Version Control
Follow commit message format: type(scope): description
Keep commits focused and atomic
Reference issues and tasks in commits
Error Handling
Implement proper error boundaries
Use consistent error logging
Include error recovery mechanisms
Performance
Implement suggested optimizations
Use the performance monitoring tools
Follow the established caching strategies

- After making changes, ALWAYS make sure to start up a new server so I can test it.


- Always look for existing code to iterate on instead of creating new code.


- Do not drastically change the patterns before trying to iterate on existing patterns.


- Always kill all existing related servers that may have been created in previous testing before trying to start a new server.


- Always prefer simple solutions


- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality


- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod


- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested


- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic.


- Keep the codebase very clean and organized


- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once


- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.


- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod


- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments


- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming


- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task


- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task


- Write thorough tests for all major functionality


- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed


- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
