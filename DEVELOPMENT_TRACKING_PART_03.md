### 2025-04-18: Wallet System Unification Initiative

**Description:**
Initiated the unification of the wallet/payment system. Identified duplicate Wallet and Transaction models in `models/marketplace.py` and `core/models/payment.py`, both using SQLAlchemy but with differing fields and logic. Confirmed no MongoDB wallet model exists. Decision made to merge into a single unified Wallet/Transaction model for all wallet, payment, and marketplace operations.

**Plan:**

- Design a unified SQLAlchemy Wallet model, including:
  - Standardized fields for user, balance, currency, status, and transaction history/logs.
  - Support for both marketplace and general payment flows.
  - Unified Transaction model with clear relationships and extensibility for future blockchain/NFT features.
- Refactor backend code and APIs to use the unified models.
- Update and expand all relevant tests (maintain 80%+ coverage).
- Document migration and model usage in code and tracking files.

**Next Steps:**

1. Draft and review unified Wallet and Transaction models.
2. Refactor backend and APIs for unified usage.
3. Update documentation and developer onboarding.
4. Add/expand tests for all wallet and payment flows.

**Estimated Time:** 4–8 hours (including refactor, migration, and testing)

---

### [2024-06-13] Wallet System Unification Progress Update

- Unified SQLAlchemy Wallet and Transaction models are now implemented in `src/dojopool/models/marketplace.py`.
- Duplicate models have been removed from `core/models/payment.py`.
- All `/wallet`, `/purchase`, and `/transactions` API endpoints in `routes/api/marketplace.py` refactored to use the new unified models and fields.
- Imports and model usage across API routes now reference the unified source of truth.
- Error handling and field compatibility updated for unified models.
- Next: expand/adjust tests for new models, verify API compatibility, and update documentation/readme as needed.

---

### [2024-06-14] Physics Engine Integration & Basic Rules Logic

Integrated the TypeScript physics engine (`PhysicsEngine`) with the real-time `GameState` manager. Implemented a game loop (`tick`) to drive physics simulation. Added pocket detection, standard 8-ball racking, scratch detection, basic ball-type assignment, 8-ball win/loss checks, and ball-in-hand logic. Refactored action handling for consistency with consensus patterns. Addressed numerous type errors and linter issues, using type assertions as workarounds where necessary due to tooling glitches.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- `GameState` (integration, tick loop, outcome analysis)
- `PhysicsEngine` (usage)
- `GameTable` (state extension)
- `GameActionType` (update)

**Key Features:**

- Physics-driven ball movement in `GameState`.
- Game loop for continuous simulation.
- Standard 8-ball rack setup.
- Pocket geometry definition and detection.
- Basic 8-ball rule logic (scratch, ball type assignment, win/loss check, ball-in-hand).
- Action handling refactored for consensus flow.

**Integration Points:**

- `GameState` uses `PhysicsEngine`.
- `GameState` `tick` method drives simulation.
- `analyzeShotOutcome` proposes actions (`CHANGE_TURN`, `END_GAME`) based on physics results and rules.

**File Paths:**

- `DojoPool/src/core/game/GameState.ts`
- `src/types/game.ts`

---

### Overall Status & Way Forward (as of 2024-07-29)

**Current State:**

- The backend infrastructure is robust, with advanced systems for scaling, security, monitoring, and context assurance in place.
- Core gameplay physics and basic 8-ball rules are integrated into the `GameState`.
- The critical Wallet system inconsistency is being actively resolved through model unification.
- A significant gap exists in frontend UI development, blocking the user-facing realization of many backend features.

**Way Forward:**

- **Immediate Priority:** Initiate focused frontend development sprints targeting critical missing UIs:
  - Wallet viewing/transactions
  - Tournament list/registration/bracket view
  - Venue management dashboard basics
  - Core Social features (Profile, Feed)
- Continue refining backend game logic (`GameState.ts` rules, fouls, etc.).
- Finalize App Store assets (screenshots, videos) for submission readiness.
- Expand test coverage, especially for the unified Wallet system.
- Plan subsequent sprints for remaining frontend UIs and advanced backend features (AI, Blockchain) as outlined in the updated `ROADMAP.md`.

**Next Priority Task:**
Refine `analyzeShotOutcome` in `GameState.ts` with detailed foul detection (no rail, wrong ball first), cue ball recovery logic, and break shot rules. **Priority:** Initiate focused frontend development sprints for key UIs (Wallet, Tournaments, Venues). Finalize App Store assets. Continue backend feature development (Advanced AI, Blockchain) as per roadmap.

Expected completion time: Ongoing (Frontend sprints), 2-3 days (GameState refinement)

### 2024-07-29: Wallet Admin Helpers and Tournament Logic (Part 1)

**Description:**
Added admin/lifecycle helper methods (freeze, reactivate, get_audit_trail) to the `Wallet` model, integrating with the existing `AuditLogger`. Created corresponding protected API endpoints (`/admin/wallet/<user_id>/freeze`, etc.) and associated tests. Began implementation of the core `TournamentService` logic, including participant registration, starting tournaments (SE, RR, DE formats with initial match generation), completing matches, and checking for tournament completion (SE, RR, basic DE).

**Core Components Implemented/Updated:**

- `models.marketplace.Wallet`: Added `freeze`, `reactivate`, `get_audit_trail` methods; integrated `AuditLogger`; added `is_active` checks.
- `core.venue.audit.AuditEventType`: Added wallet-specific event types.
- `routes.api.marketplace`: Added admin endpoints for wallet management.
- `tests.test_wallet_api`: Added tests for admin wallet endpoints.
- `models.tournament.TournamentMatch`: Added `bracket_type` field.
- `services.tournament_service`: Refactored `register_player`, `start_tournament`. Implemented match generation (`_create_single_elimination_brackets`, `_create_round_robin_matches`, `_create_double_elimination_brackets`). Implemented `complete_match` with advancement logic for SE and DE (winners/losers). Implemented `_check_tournament_completion` for SE, RR, and basic DE.
- `tests.test_tournament_service`: Added initial tests for `register_player`, `start_tournament`, and `complete_match`.

**File Paths:**

- `DojoPool/src/dojopool/models/marketplace.py`
- `DojoPool/src/dojopool/core/venue/audit.py`

Expected completion time: 3-5 days (depending on complexity of Swiss/DE edge cases)

**Update [2024-07-30]:** Swiss pairing and DE Grand Finals logic implemented. Comprehensive service tests (Swiss edge cases, DE bye propagation) and API tests added.

---

### 2024-07-30: Tournament Logic (Swiss Pairing & DE Grand Finals)

**Description:**
Implemented core logic for Swiss tournament format pairing in `TournamentService`. Added `_create_swiss_pairing` method handling round 1 (random) and subsequent rounds (score-based, avoiding rematches). Updated `complete_match` to trigger next round pairing for Swiss. Enhanced Double Elimination logic by refining `_advance_winner_bracket` and `_advance_loser_bracket` to detect finals and call `_create_or_update_grand_final`. Implemented Grand Final handling in `complete_match`, including the creation of a reset match (`_create_grand_final_reset`) if the LB winner wins the first GF. Updated `_check_tournament_completion` for DE to correctly identify completion based on GF/reset results. Added initial tests for Swiss pairing (R1 even/odd, R2 trigger) and DE Grand Final scenarios (WB win, LB win + reset).

**Core Components Implemented/Updated:**

- `services.tournament_service`: Added `_get_participant_swiss_scores`, `_get_previous_opponents`, `_create_swiss_pairing`, `_create_or_update_grand_final`, `_create_grand_final_reset`. Updated `start_tournament`, `complete_match`, `_advance_winner_bracket`, `_advance_loser_bracket`, `_check_tournament_completion`.

- `DojoPool/tests/test_tournament_service.py`

**Next Priority Task:**
**Update [2024-07-30]:** Task Complete. Moved to Overall Status Next Priority.
