# Feature Spec: Network Transport Error Recovery & Resilience

## Overview
The network transport layer must provide robust error recovery and resilience mechanisms to ensure reliable communication between distributed nodes, even in the presence of failures or network issues.

## Requirements
- Circuit breaker pattern for peer connections (OPEN, HALF_OPEN, CLOSED states)
- Exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Message queue limit and timeout handling
- Connection health monitoring and automatic reconnection
- Failure tracking and threshold management
- Graceful degradation and fallback strategies
- Logging and metrics for error events and recovery actions
- Integration with monitoring and alerting systems
- Comprehensive integration tests for failure scenarios

## Integration Points
- NetworkTransport class (core logic)
- NetworkErrorRecovery class (error handling, retries)
- Monitoring/metrics system (Prometheus, dashboards)
- AlertManager (thresholds, notifications)
- Test suite (integration and performance tests)

## Prompt Example
```
Create a network transport layer that:
- Implements circuit breaker and exponential backoff for error recovery.
- Monitors connection health and manages retries with jitter.
- Logs and reports errors, and integrates with monitoring and alerting systems.
- Includes comprehensive integration tests for resilience.
