# specs

This folder contains feature specifications and prompt-driven plans for agentic coding workflows. Use this folder to document requirements, plans, and detailed specs for new and existing features.

## Purpose
- **Agentic Coding Plans:** This folder is the home for all feature plans, PRDs, and detailed specs that guide AI/agentic coding tools.
- **Blueprint for AI Work:** Each spec should be actionable, clear, and detailed enough for an AI agent to execute with minimal back-and-forth.

## Best Practices
- Write specs before building new features or making major changes.
- Use clear, structured sections: Problem, Solution, Implementation Steps, Validation, and References.
- Reference related docs in `/ai-docs` and relevant prompts in `/.claude`.
- Update specs as features evolve and keep them in sync with the codebase.
- Archive or remove outdated specs to avoid confusion.

## Folder Relationships
- `specs/`: Feature plans and agentic coding specs
- `ai-docs/`: Persistent knowledge base for AI/agentic tools
- `.claude/`: Reusable prompts and context priming scripts

For best results, keep this folder organized and cross-reference with `/ai-docs` and `/.claude` folders.
