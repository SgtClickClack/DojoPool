### {datetime}: Codebase Audit & Feature Mapping Completed

**Description:**
Performed a detailed analysis of the existing DojoPool codebase (`src/frontend/`, `src/dojopool/`). Mapped components, services, models, and APIs to the features outlined in the "Dojo Pool Game Flow Instructions" document. Created a Feature Box Mapping document (v1) summarizing findings and updated `ROADMAP.md` checklists and added an Audit Summary section.

**Core Components Implemented/Reviewed:**

- Authentication & Profile (Frontend Contexts, Backend API/Models)
- Dashboard Hub (Basic Frontend)
- Game Management (Frontend Forms/Lists, Backend API/Models)
- Core Gameplay (Frontend View Stub, Backend API/Models, Websockets)
- Map & Dojo Discovery (Backend API/Models)
- Venue Interaction (Backend Services/Models, Frontend Check-in UI)
- Tournament System (Backend API/Models)
- AI Services (Backend Services/Models)
- Post-Game & Rewards (Backend Services/Models - Achievements/Prizes)
- Wallet System (Multiple Backend implementations found)
- Analytics & Stats (Extensive Backend Services/Models, Basic Frontend displays)
- Notifications (Backend Service/Models)
- Social Features (Backend API/Service/Models)
- Marketplace (Backend API/Models)

**Key Findings & Gaps:**

- Generally strong backend foundation with many services and models.
- Significant number of Frontend UIs are missing or need creation/integration (Map, Avatar Editor, Virtual Dojo, Tournaments, Trophies, Wallet, Full Analytics, Notifications, Social, Marketplace).
- **Critical:** Wallet system implementation shows inconsistencies (SQLAlchemy models in `models/marketplace.py` and `core/models/payment.py` vs. MongoDB usage suggested in `routes/api/marketplace.py`). Needs immediate investigation.
- Potential duplication/overlap in Venue Check-in logic/models (`services/checkin_service.py`, `models/venue_checkin.py`, `core/models/venue.py`).
- NFT implementation details are unclear.
- Blockchain integration is marked as TODO.
- Some API endpoints need clarification or completion (e.g., `/avatar`, venue map APIs).

**File Paths:**

- `DojoPool/src/frontend/`
- `DojoPool/src/dojopool/`
- `DojoPool/ROADMAP.md`
- `DojoPool/DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING_CONSOLIDATED.md`

**Next Priority Task:**

**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours (Investigation & Planning)

### 2024-07-26: Codebase Audit - Game Flow Feature Mapping

Performed a high-level audit mapping existing codebase components to the core game flow features outlined in the ROADMAP.

- **Digital Platform:**
  - Game State (`game_state`): Partially implemented, rules need review.
  - Tournament System (`tournament_manager`, `src/components/TournamentDisplay.tsx`): Basic backend exists, frontend UI mostly done but needs linking and refinement. Prize distribution requires Wallet integration.
  - Social Features (`user_profile`, `friend_system`, `chat_service`, `achievement_system`): Basic backend structures exist for profiles, friends, chat. Frontend integration needed. Achievements backend is more advanced, frontend mostly done. Alliances/Rivalry missing.
  - Currency/Wallet (`wallet_models_sql`, `wallet_models_mongo`, `currency_service`): **CRITICAL ISSUE** - Conflicting data models (SQLAlchemy & MongoDB) and service logic found. Needs immediate investigation and reconciliation. Frontend UI missing. Smart contracts missing.

  - Shot Analysis (`shot_analyzer`): Partially implemented.
  - Performance Monitoring (`performance_tracker`): Advanced backend, frontend mostly done.
- **Technical Infrastructure:** Solid foundation (FastAPI, React, Docker). CI/CD needs setup. Logging/Monitoring needs implementation. Database schemas need reconciliation (see Currency/Wallet).
