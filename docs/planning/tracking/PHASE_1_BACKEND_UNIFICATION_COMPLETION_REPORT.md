### 2025-09-02: Phase 1 - Backend Unification & Schema Consolidation (COMPLETED)

**Summary:**

- Backend unified on NestJS (`services/api/src/main.ts`); no legacy Express server remains.
- Real-time features run via NestJS Gateways with namespaced Socket.IO.
- Single canonical Prisma schema at `packages/prisma/schema.prisma`; API configured accordingly.
- ESLint active across core workspaces; Vitest unit/integration configs enforce 80% thresholds.
- CI workflow added to lint and run tests with coverage via Yarn v4.

**Core Components Verified:**

- `services/api/src/main.ts`, gateways, CORS, helmet, rate limits
- `packages/prisma/schema.prisma` only; generation from single schema
- `eslint.config.js` covers apps/, services/, packages/
- `vitest.unit.config.ts`, `vitest.integration.config.ts` (80% thresholds)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (type-check, lint, tests)

**Deliverables:**

- Express server removed; unified backend on port 3002
- Real-time via NestJS Gateways
- Single Prisma schema source of truth
- Lint/test restored with CI gates

**Verdict:** GO
