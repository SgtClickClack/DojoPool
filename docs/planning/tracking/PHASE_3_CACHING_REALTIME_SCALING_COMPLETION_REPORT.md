### 2025-09-02: Phase 3 - Caching & Real-time Scaling (COMPLETED)

**Summary:**

- Standardized caching layer implemented via decorators and `CacheHelper` with write-through + pattern invalidation.
- Read-heavy controllers (tournaments, marketplace, notifications) protected with `@Cacheable`; writes use `@CacheInvalidate`.
- Production real-time scaling enforced: Redis adapter required; app fails fast in production without Redis.
- Simulation/background broadcasting gated behind feature flags and disabled in production.

**Core Components Verified:**

- `services/api/src/cache/cache.decorator.ts` (Cacheable, CacheWriteThrough, CacheInvalidate)
- `services/api/src/cache/cache.helper.ts` (write-through + invalidation utilities)
- `services/api/src/tournaments/tournaments.controller.ts` (cached endpoints + invalidations)
- `services/api/src/marketplace/marketplace.controller.ts` (cached items + invalidation on buy)
- `services/api/src/notifications/notifications.controller.ts` (cached list/unread count, guarded)
- `services/api/src/redis/redis.service.ts` (mandatory Redis in production; adapter creation)
- `services/api/src/main.ts` (WS adapter selection with production enforcement)

**Deliverables:**

- Standardized caching helper/decorators in place
- Read-heavy endpoints covered by cache
- Pattern-based invalidation to prevent stale data
- Production startup fails without Redis configuration
- Background simulations disabled in production

**Verdict:** GO
