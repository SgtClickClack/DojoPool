### 2024-07-16: Frontend Implementation for Dojo Coin Wallet and Rewards System (Partial)

Started implementing the frontend for the wallet and rewards system. Updated the `RewardItem` type for consistency and modified `RewardsDashboard.tsx` to display different reward types based on their `type` field (dojo_coins, nft, achievement, boost). Integrated the `WalletTransactionList.tsx` component into `RewardsDashboard.tsx` to display transaction history, replacing the previous manual list rendering.

Encountered persistent linter errors in `RewardsDashboard.tsx` after integrating `WalletTransactionList`, primarily related to type imports and usage, despite attempts to fix.

**Core Components Implemented:**

- `RewardsDashboard.tsx` (modified for different reward types and transaction list integration)
- `WalletTransactionList.tsx` (integrated)
- `RewardItem` type (updated in `types/rewards.ts`)

**File Paths:**

- src/features/rewards/RewardsDashboard.tsx
- src/components/wallet/WalletTransactionList.tsx
- src/types/rewards.ts
- src/types/wallet.ts (involved in import issues)

**Next Priority Task:**
Fix linter errors in `RewardsDashboard.tsx` and continue implementing remaining wallet/rewards frontend features (e.g., adding coins, transfer functionality, detailed transaction view).

Expected completion time: 1 hour
