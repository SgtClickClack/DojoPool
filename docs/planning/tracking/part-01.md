Continue with the next outstanding user journey or technical feature (e.g., post-game analytics or rewards processing).

Expected completion time: 1 day

### 2025-05-12: Backend Stability & Login Restoration

Resolved critical and persistent issues preventing the Python Flask backend server from starting reliably and the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint from functioning. This involved extensive debugging of SQLAlchemy initialization errors (NoForeignKeysError, MappperInitializationError), database schema mismatches, Flask-Migrate workflow correction, and Python environment (PYTHONPATH, __pycache__) issues.

**Core Components Implemented/Fixed:**
- Corrected SQLAlchemy model relationships (User, Friendship, Location, Venue, Inventory) to use fully qualified string names or TYPE_CHECKING imports to avoid circular dependencies and ensure proper mapper configuration.
- Standardized Flask application configuration loading, ensuring the `DevelopmentConfig` uses an absolute path for `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` (`src/instance/dojopool_dev.db`).
- Established a clean and repeatable Flask-Migrate workflow:
    - Cleared stale migration files and the existing database.
    - Created a blank initial revision (`flask db revision`).
    - Stamped the database to this blank revision (`flask db stamp <revision_id>`).
    - Generated a new, comprehensive migration from current models (`flask db migrate`).
    - Applied the new migration (`flask db upgrade`).
- Ensured Python `__pycache__` directories were cleared to prevent stale bytecode from interfering with model loading.
- Successfully started the Flask server and confirmed the `/api/v1/auth/login` endpoint returns a 200 OK with an access token for valid credentials.

**Key Features Restored:**
- Backend server stability.
- User authentication via API login.
- Foundational database integrity for core models.

**Integration Points:**
- Python Flask application startup (`[PY]run.py`, `src/dojopool/app.py`)
- SQLAlchemy ORM (`src/dojopool/models/*`)
- Flask-Migrate (`migrations/`)
- Configuration (`src/dojopool/core/config/development.py`)
- API Authentication (`src/dojopool/api/v1/resources/auth.py`)

**File Paths:**
- `[PY]run.py`
- `src/dojopool/app.py`
- `src/dojopool/core/config/development.py`
- `src/dojopool/models/user.py`
- `src/dojopool/models/friendship.py`
- `src/dojopool/models/location.py`
- `src/dojopool/models/venue.py`
- `src/dojopool/models/inventory.py`
- `src/dojopool/api/v1/resources/auth.py`
- `migrations/` directory (workflow standardized)
- `src/instance/dojopool_dev.db` (schema corrected)

**Next Priority Task:**
Proceed with outstanding tasks from DEVELOPMENT_TRACKING_PART_02.md, starting with "AI Referee (Sky-T1) integration tests" now that the Node.js/npm environment issue is (presumed) resolved and the backend is stable. If Node.js issues persist, address those first.

Expected completion time: Ongoing (for PART_02 tasks)

### 2024-07-16: Logging Consolidation and ErrorLoggingService Refactor

Consolidated all error logging to use a single canonical `ErrorLoggingService` in `src/services/`. Updated all imports in frontend and error boundary components to use this service, removed the duplicate from `src/core/services/`, and ensured all error logging flows through the unified service. This improves maintainability, error tracking, and code clarity.

**Core Components Implemented:**
- Canonical `ErrorLoggingService` in `src/services/`
- Updated all `logError` imports in frontend and error boundary components
- Removed duplicate service from `src/core/services/`

**File Paths:**
- src/services/ErrorLoggingService.ts
- src/components/common/ErrorBoundary.tsx
- src/dojopool/frontend/components/ErrorBoundary/[ERR]ErrorBoundary.tsx
- src/dojopool/frontend/[UI]App.tsx
- src/core/services/ErrorLoggingService.ts (deleted)

**Next Priority Task:**
Address file/directory naming and placement inconsistencies within the `src/` directory, focusing on moving prefixed files into appropriate subdirectories and removing non-standard prefixes, as outlined in the dev tracking index.

Expected completion time: 1 hour
