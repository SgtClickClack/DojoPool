### 2025-09-02: Phase 2 - Frontend Maintainability & Deduplication (COMPLETED)

**Summary:**

- `apps/web/src/pages/inventory.tsx` is lean and composes modular components.
- Inventory UI split into focused components under `components/Inventory/`.
- Single canonical `404.tsx` present; no duplicate `404.js` remains.
- Single authoritative services: `APIService.ts`, `WebSocketService.ts`.
- Import aliasing standardized: replaced long relative paths with `@/*` in tests where applicable.

**Core Components Verified:**

- `apps/web/src/pages/inventory.tsx` (lean container)
- `apps/web/src/components/Inventory/*` (16 modular components)
- `apps/web/src/pages/404.tsx` (canonical 404)
- `apps/web/src/services/APIService.ts`
- `apps/web/src/services/WebSocketService.ts`
- `apps/web/src/components/CMS/__tests__/CMSDashboard.test.tsx` (alias fix)

**Deliverables:**

- Modular, maintainable inventory page composed of reusable components
- No duplicate pages/services; single sources of truth
- Consistent `@/*` import alias usage; ESLint rule guards against long relative paths

**Verdict:** GO
