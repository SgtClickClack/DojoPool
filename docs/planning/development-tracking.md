### Notes
- All image-related changes follow guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Regular testing needed for image assets using test_image_assets.py
- Keep monitoring performance metrics for image loading
- Core brand images (LogoDojoPool.jpg and PosterDojoPool.jpg) maintain original case
- All other images must use lowercase naming
