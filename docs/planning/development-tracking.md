├── backgrounds/    # Background images
├── features/      # Feature images
├── icons/         # UI icons
└── webp/          # WebP versions of images
```

#### Dependencies Added
- pytest==7.4.3
- Pillow==10.1.0
- Flask==3.0.0
- tinify==1.6.0 (TinyPNG/TinyJPG compression)
- watchdog==6.0.0 (File system monitoring)
- tqdm (Progress bars)

### Next Steps
1. Performance Testing
   - [ ] Measure compression ratios
   - [ ] Test loading times
   - [ ] Verify WebP fallbacks
   - [ ] Monitor memory usage
   - [ ] Set up performance metrics tracking
   - [ ] Monitor image loading times
   - [ ] Track WebP usage and fallbacks
   - [ ] Analyze lazy loading effectiveness

2. Documentation Updates
   - [ ] Add optimization guidelines
   - [ ] Document compression settings
   - [ ] Create WebP usage guide
   - [ ] Update image loading documentation

### Notes
- All image-related changes follow guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Regular testing needed for image assets using test_image_assets.py
- Keep monitoring performance metrics for image loading
- Core brand images (LogoDojoPool.jpg and PosterDojoPool.jpg) maintain original case
- All other images must use lowercase naming
- TinyPNG API key required for optimal compression
- WebP versions automatically generated
- File watcher monitors for new images
- Lazy loading added to all image tags
- Regular optimization checks recommended
