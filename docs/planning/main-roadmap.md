- Consolidate duplicate files
- Remove dead code and unused assets
- Organize shared utilities and components
- Implement consistent naming conventions

#### Phase 3: Code Quality Enhancement (2-3 weeks)
- Implement consistent code formatting
- Add comprehensive documentation
- Enhance error handling and logging
- Optimize imports and dependencies
- Implement code quality metrics

#### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (1-2 weeks)
- Add missing unit tests
- Implement integration tests
- Validate all component interactions
- Performance testing and optimization
- Security audit and fixes

#### Phase 5: Maintenance and Monitoring (Ongoing)
- Regular dependency updates
- Performance monitoring
- Code quality metrics tracking
- Technical debt management
- Documentation updates
