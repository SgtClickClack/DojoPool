## Process

1. **Initial Assessment** (Essential for all versions)
   - Understand app idea and scope
   - Identify target audience
   - Define key features
   - Determine platform requirements
   - Establish timeline

2. **Technical Planning** (Scale based on project needs)
   - Frontend architecture
   - Backend architecture
   - State management
   - Database design
   - API communication
   - DevOps strategy

3. **Documentation Generation** (Prioritized by project phase)
   - Essential Documents (MVP Phase)
   - Extended Documents (Growth Phase)
   - Optional Documents (Scale Phase)

## Documentation Structure

## Team Size Considerations

### Solo Developer

- Focus on `prd.md` and `architecture.md`
- Combine related documents
- Use simplified templates
- Document as you build

### Small Team (2-4)

- Use the Lite Version
- Focus on essential documents
- Combine frontend/backend docs
- Prioritize API and database documentation

### Medium Team (5-10)

- Use Full Version
- Separate frontend/backend docs
- Add DevOps and testing plans
- Regular documentation reviews

### Large Team (10+)

- Use Full Version
- Detailed component documentation
- Comprehensive testing plans
- Regular documentation audits

## MVP vs Full Product

### MVP Phase

Essential focus areas:

1. **Product Requirements (P0)**
   - Core features only
   - Primary user flows
   - Key technical requirements

2. **Architecture (P0)**
   - Basic system design
   - Core technology choices
   - Essential integrations

3. **API Design (P0)**
   - Core endpoints
   - Basic error handling
   - Essential security

4. **Database Schema (P0)**
   - Core entities
   - Essential relationships
   - Basic indexes

### Growth Phase

Additional focus areas:

1. **Frontend (P1)**
   - Component architecture
   - State management
   - Performance optimization

2. **Backend (P1)**
   - Service architecture
   - Caching strategy
   - Error handling

3. **User Flows (P1)**
   - Extended user journeys
   - Error scenarios
   - Edge cases

4. **Security (P1)**
   - Advanced authentication
   - Authorization rules
   - Data protection

### Scale Phase

Optional areas based on needs:

1. **DevOps (P2)**
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Monitoring
   - Scaling strategy

2. **Performance (P2)**
   - Load testing
   - Optimization
   - Caching strategy

3. **Testing (P2)**
   - Test automation
   - Integration tests
   - Performance tests

## Document Templates

### Lite Version Template (MVP Phase)

```markdown
# Project Documentation

## Overview

[App name, description, and core features]

## Architecture

[Combined frontend/backend architecture]

## API & Database

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Choose Your Version**
   - Assess team size
   - Consider project complexity
   - Evaluate timeline constraints

2. **Information Gathering**
   - Focus on essential questions first
   - Scale detail based on project phase
   - Adapt to team expertise

3. **Document Generation**
