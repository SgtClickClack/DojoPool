# DojoPool Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security practices and procedures for the DojoPool project. It serves as a guide for developers and administrators to maintain the security of the application.

## Security Measures

### 1. Environment Variables
- All sensitive information is stored in environment variables
- Two environment files are maintained:
  - `.env` for production configuration
  - `.env.test` for test environment
- Required variables:
  ```
  GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
  SECRET_KEY
  DATABASE_URL
  ```

### 2. SSL Certificates
- Production certificates are stored in `certs/production/`
- Development certificates are stored in `certs/development/`
- Certificate backups are maintained in `certs/backup/`
- Automatic certificate rotation is implemented for certificates nearing expiration (30 days)
- Self-signed certificates are used for development only

### 3. Security Headers
The following security headers are required in the Nginx configuration:
```nginx
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY";
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
```

## Automated Security Tools

### 1. Security Checker
Location: `docs/cleanup/scripts/automated_security_check.py`

Features:
- Certificate expiration monitoring
- Environment file validation
- Exposed secrets detection
- Security header verification

Usage:
```bash
python docs/cleanup/scripts/automated_security_check.py
```

Reports are generated in `docs/cleanup/security_reports/`

### 2. Certificate Rotator
Location: `docs/cleanup/scripts/certificate_rotation.py`

Features:
- Automatic detection of expiring certificates
- Certificate backup creation
- New certificate generation
- Nginx configuration updates
- Automatic Nginx reload

Usage:
```bash
python docs/cleanup/scripts/certificate_rotation.py
```

Logs are stored in `logs/certificates/`

## Security Procedures

### 1. Regular Security Audits
- Run automated security checks weekly
- Review security reports
- Address any identified issues
- Update security documentation as needed

### 2. Certificate Management
- Monitor certificate expiration dates
- Rotate certificates before expiration
- Maintain secure backups
- Document all certificate changes

### 3. Secret Management
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Maintain secure backups of configuration

### 4. Development Practices
- Use HTTPS for all production traffic
- Implement proper input validation
- Follow secure coding guidelines
- Regular security training for team members

## Incident Response

### 1. Security Breach
In case of a security breach:
1. Immediately revoke compromised credentials
2. Rotate all secrets and certificates
3. Document the incident
4. Review and update security measures

### 2. Certificate Expiration
If a certificate expires:
1. Generate new certificate immediately
2. Update Nginx configuration
3. Reload Nginx
4. Document the incident
5. Review certificate monitoring

## Best Practices

### 1. Code Security
- Regular code reviews with security focus
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secure configuration management

### 2. Infrastructure Security
- Regular system updates
- Firewall configuration
- Access control implementation
- Monitoring and logging

### 3. Development Workflow
- Secure development environment setup
- Code review requirements
- Testing requirements
- Deployment security checks

## Training

### 1. Developer Onboarding
New developers must:
1. Review this security documentation
2. Set up secure development environment
3. Complete security training
4. Understand incident response procedures

### 2. Regular Training
Team members should:
1. Participate in security reviews
2. Stay updated on security best practices
3. Report potential security issues
4. Contribute to security documentation

## Maintenance

### 1. Documentation Updates
- Review and update documentation monthly
- Track all security-related changes
- Maintain changelog
- Version control documentation

### 2. Security Tools
- Keep security tools updated
- Review and improve automation
- Add new security checks as needed
- Document tool usage and results
