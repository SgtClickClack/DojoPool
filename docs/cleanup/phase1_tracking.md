- [x] Standardize component file organization

### Styles

- [x] Analyze SCSS/CSS structure
- [x] Document global styles and themes
- [x] Identify duplicate style definitions
- [x] Plan style organization improvements

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- [x] Review utility functions
- [x] Document API integrations
- [x] Analyze state management patterns
- [x] Identify areas for TypeScript migration

### Python Backend

- [x] Document core utility modules and dependencies
- [x] Refactor RoomLogger to use QueryBuilder pattern
- [x] Implement unified logging framework
- [x] Update database optimization module
- [x] Review database models and relationships
- [x] Analyze API routes and handlers
- [x] Document background tasks and workers

## Identified Issues

### High Priority

1. Complex Query Methods in RoomLogger
   - `get_room_events` (complexity: 17, 64 lines)
   - `get_room_access_logs` (complexity: 17, 64 lines)
   - `get_room_audit_logs` (complexity: 19, 68 lines)
   - ✓ Created QueryBuilder class for log queries
   - ✓ Simplified query methods
   - ✓ Improved error handling

2. Logging System Consolidation
   - Multiple logging implementations across:
     - `room_logging.py`
     - `utils.py`
     - `db_optimization.py`
   - ✓ Created unified logging framework
   - ✓ Implemented BaseLogger class
   - ✓ Added specialized DatabaseLogger
   - ✓ Updated RoomLogger to use new framework

3. Database Optimization Framework
   - ✓ Enhanced db_optimization.py with improved logging
   - ✓ Added query profiling and monitoring
   - ✓ Implemented connection pool management
   - ✓ Added caching integration
   - ✓ Added detailed query statistics

4. Large Utility Functions
   - ✓ `log_function_call` (59 lines) refactored into smaller functions
   - ✓ Action: Split into smaller, focused functions

### Medium Priority

1. ~~SCSS utility files need organization~~ (RESOLVED)
2. ~~Multiple logging implementations~~ (RESOLVED)
3. ~~Duplicate test scenarios~~ (RESOLVED)
4. ~~Documentation gaps in core functionality~~ (RESOLVED)

### Low Priority

1. ~~Inconsistent file naming conventions~~ (RESOLVED)
2. ~~Markdown files need structure~~ (RESOLVED)
3. ~~CSS/SCSS split needs standardization~~ (RESOLVED)
4. ~~Test coverage gaps~~ (RESOLVED)
