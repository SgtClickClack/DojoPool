# Security Cleanup Progress

## Priority 1: HIGH Risk - API Keys and Secrets
### 1.1 Client Secrets and API Keys
- [x] Move `instance/client_secret.json` to secure storage
- [x] Remove API keys from `build/static/js/main.23f9391b.js`
- [x] Implement environment-based configuration for API keys

### 1.2 Test Environment Secrets
- [x] Move test secrets to `.env.test`
- [x] Update test files to use environment variables
- [x] Remove hardcoded secrets from test files

## Priority 2: Certificate Management
### 2.1 Production Certificates
- [x] Consolidate SSL certificates to single location
- [x] Remove duplicate certificates
- [x] Implement proper certificate rotation system

### 2.2 Development Certificates
- [x] Move development certificates to dev-specific directory
- [x] Create script to generate development certificates
- [x] Document certificate management procedures

## Priority 3: MEDIUM Risk - Configuration and Passwords
### 3.1 Configuration Files
- [x] Review and clean `context_validation.yaml`
- [x] Move sensitive settings to environment variables
- [x] Update configuration loading system

### 3.2 Test Credentials
- [x] Create secure test credential management system
- [x] Update test configurations
- [x] Document test security procedures

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Secure Storage Setup ✅
1. [x] Create secure storage location for secrets
2. [x] Set up environment variable management
3. [x] Document secret management procedures

### Step 2: Certificate Consolidation ✅
1. [x] Audit all certificates
2. [x] Create certificate management structure
3. [x] Move certificates to appropriate locations

### Step 3: Code Updates ✅
1. [x] Update application code to use environment variables
2. [x] Modify test suite for secure credential handling
3. [x] Implement secure configuration loading

### Step 4: Cleanup ✅
1. [x] Remove exposed secrets
2. [x] Delete duplicate certificates
3. [x] Verify all sensitive data is secured

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Items
- Initial security audit
- Secret migration to environment variables
- Certificate organization and management
- Code updates for secure configuration
- Test suite updates for secure credentials
- Documentation of security procedures

### In Progress
- None

### Blocked Items
- None

## Notes
- All certificates have been backed up to `certs/backup` directory
- Environment variables are now managed through `.env` files
- Development certificates are generated automatically
- Test credentials are managed through `.env.test`
- All code has been updated to use environment variables
- Duplicate certificates have been consolidated

## Next Steps
1. Regular security audits should be scheduled
2. Certificate rotation should be automated
3. Security documentation should be maintained
4. Team should be trained on new security procedures
