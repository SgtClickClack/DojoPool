- Models are versioned using semantic versioning
- Updates are deployed through the model registry
- Backward compatibility is maintained
- Performance metrics are tracked

### Calibration

- Models require initial calibration
- Regular recalibration based on new data
- Adaptation to player progress
- Performance validation

## Integration Guidelines

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// Real-time shot analysis
const analyzer = new ShotAnalyzer();
analyzer.onFrame(frame => {
    const feedback = await analyzer.analyzeShotFrame(frame);
    updateUI(feedback);
});

// Game analysis dashboard
const gameAnalyzer = new GameAnalyzer();
gameAnalyzer.onGameComplete(game => {
    const analysis = await gameAnalyzer.analyzeGame(game);
    updateDashboard(analysis);
});
```

### Backend Integration

```python
# Shot analysis webhook
@app.post("/api/shot-analysis")
async def analyze_shot(video: UploadFile):
    analyzer = ShotAnalyzer()
    results = await analyzer.analyze_shot(video.file)
    return results

# Game analysis background task
@app.post("/api/game-analysis")
async def analyze_game(game_id: str):
    analyzer = GameAnalyzer()
    results = await analyzer.analyze_game(
        await get_game_data(game_id)
    )
    await store_analysis(game_id, results)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Real-time Processing

- Shot analysis: <100ms per frame
- Game analysis: <1s for updates
- Prediction: <2s for full analysis

### Resource Requirements
