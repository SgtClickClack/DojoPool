### Authorization System
1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   ```
   Roles:

   - Tournament Organizer
   - Administrator
   - System Service
   ```

2. **Permission Matrix**
   ```
   Resources:

   - Manage
   ```

3. **Access Control Lists (ACL)**
   - Resource-level permissions
   - User-specific permissions
   - Group permissions
   - Inheritance rules

## Data Security

### Data Classification
1. **Sensitive Data**
   - Personal information
   - Payment details
   - Authentication credentials
   - Session tokens

2. **Business Data**
   - Game records
   - Tournament data
   - Venue information
   - Analytics data

### Data Protection
1. **Encryption**
   - AES-256 for data at rest
   - TLS 1.3 for data in transit
   - End-to-end encryption for chat
   - Key rotation policies

2. **Data Masking**
   - Credit card numbers
   - Personal identifiers
   - Authentication tokens
   - API keys

### Data Retention
1. **Retention Policies**
   - User data: 7 years
   - Game data: 5 years
   - Logs: 1 year
   - Backups: 30 days

2. **Data Deletion**
   - Secure erasure methods
   - Automated cleanup
   - Audit trails
   - Recovery procedures

## Network Security

### Infrastructure Security
1. **Firewall Rules**
   ```
   Inbound:
   - 80/443 (HTTP/HTTPS)
   - 22 (SSH, restricted)
   - 5432 (PostgreSQL, internal)
   - 6379 (Redis, internal)

   Outbound:
   - Restricted to necessary services
   ```

2. **Network Segmentation**
   - Public subnet
   - Private subnet
   - Database subnet
   - Management subnet

### API Security
1. **Rate Limiting**
   ```
   Limits:
   - 100 requests/minute (authenticated)
   - 20 requests/minute (unauthenticated)
   - 1000 requests/day (per API key)
   ```

2. **Input Validation**
   - Request sanitization
   - Schema validation
   - Content validation
   - File upload restrictions

## Monitoring & Detection

### Security Monitoring
1. **Log Monitoring**

   2. Analysis
   3. Containment
   4. Eradication
   5. Recovery
   6. Lessons Learned
   ```

2. **Contact Matrix**
   - Security team
   - System administrators
   - Legal team
   - Management
