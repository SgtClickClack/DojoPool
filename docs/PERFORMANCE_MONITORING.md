# Performance Monitoring

This document outlines the performance monitoring system for image optimization in DojoPool.

## Overview

The system tracks various metrics related to image optimization and sends alerts when performance regressions are detected. Key metrics include:

- Total image size and optimization rates
- WebP and AVIF format adoption rates
- Lazy loading implementation rates
- Performance trends over time

## Components

### 1. Performance Tracking (`track_performance.py`)

This script collects and stores performance metrics in a SQLite database. It tracks:

- Total number of images
- Original and optimized sizes
- WebP and AVIF adoption rates
- Lazy loading implementation
- Responsive image usage
- Preloaded images count

### 2. Performance Monitoring (`monitor_performance.py`)

This script analyzes performance metrics and sends alerts when:

- Total image size increases by more than 5%
- WebP or AVIF adoption rates decrease by more than 5%
- Lazy loading implementation rate drops by more than 5%

### 3. Performance Dashboard

A web interface available at `/performance` that displays:

- Current performance metrics
- Historical trends
- Size optimization charts
- Format adoption trends

## Setup

1. Configure email alerts by setting the following environment variables:
   ```
   SMTP_HOST=your.smtp.server
   SMTP_PORT=587
   SMTP_USER=your_username
   SMTP_PASS=your_password
   ALERT_EMAIL=alerts@yourdomain.com
   ```

2. Schedule daily monitoring:
   - Windows: Use Task Scheduler to run `run_performance_scripts.bat`
   - Linux/Mac: Add a cron job to run the scripts daily

   Example cron entry:
   ```
   0 0 * * * cd /path/to/dojopool && python scripts/track_performance.py && python scripts/monitor_performance.py
   ```

## Alert Thresholds

Current alert thresholds are:

- Size increase: 5%
- WebP adoption decrease: 5%
- AVIF adoption decrease: 5%
- Lazy loading decrease: 5%

These can be adjusted in `monitor_performance.py`.

## Data Storage

Performance metrics are stored in:

- `performance_history.db`: SQLite database containing historical metrics
- `performance_tracking.log`: Log file for the tracking script
- `performance_monitoring.log`: Log file for the monitoring script

## Dashboard Access

The performance dashboard is available at:
```
http://your-domain/performance
```

It provides visualizations of:
- Current metrics
- Historical trends
- Size optimization progress
- Format adoption rates

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks:

1. Review logs in `performance_*.log` files
2. Check alert thresholds in `monitor_performance.py`
3. Monitor database size and clean up old records if needed
4. Verify email alert configuration

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. Missing metrics:
   - Check if tracking script is running
   - Verify database permissions
   - Check log files for errors

2. No alerts:
   - Verify email configuration
   - Check alert thresholds
   - Review monitoring logs

3. Dashboard not showing data:
   - Verify database connection
   - Check for database corruption
   - Review application logs

## Contributing

When making changes to the monitoring system:

1. Update thresholds in `monitor_performance.py`
2. Test email alerts with new configurations
3. Update this documentation
4. Review and update dashboard visualizations
