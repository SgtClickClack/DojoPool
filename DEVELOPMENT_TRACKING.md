- Test coverage: 100% for image processing module

### Recent Changes
- Added comprehensive test suite for image processing
- Implemented error handling for edge cases
- Added size variant generation tests
- Completed documentation updates

### Daily Tracking
2024-03-25: Completed image processing test suite implementation
- Added 7 test cases covering core functionality
- Achieved 100% test coverage for image processing module
- Verified WebP conversion and optimization
- Validated size variant generation
- Tested error handling scenarios

### Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of cache management system
2. Set up A/B testing framework
3. Investigate AVIF format support

### Resource Allocation
- Development: 2 developers
- QA: 1 tester
- Documentation: 1 technical writer

### Timeline
- Sprint completion: End of March 2024
- Next sprint planning: First week of April 2024

### Risk Assessment
- Low: Test coverage is comprehensive
- Medium: Cache management complexity
- Low: Documentation completeness

### Notes
