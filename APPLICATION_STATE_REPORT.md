## 4. Architecture Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Modern Tech Stack:** Uses latest versions of Next.js, React, and TypeScript
2. **Comprehensive Testing:** Vitest, Jest, and Cypress for full test coverage
3. **Security-First:** Proper headers, CORS, authentication, and validation
4. **Production Ready:** Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
5. **Real-time Capabilities:** Socket.IO integration for multiplayer features
6. **Database Management:** Prisma ORM with proper migrations
7. **Performance Optimized:** Webpack optimizations, image optimization, caching

### Identified Issues & Recommendations
1. **Mixed Frontend Frameworks:** Uses both Next.js and Vite configurations
   - **Recommendation:** Standardize on Next.js as primary build tool
2. **Routing Inconsistency:** Multiple routing systems (Next.js, React Router, Flask)
   - **Recommendation:** Adopt consistent Next.js routing strategy
3. **Port Configuration:** API calls target port 8080 but Flask runs on 5000
   - **Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Next.js config proxies API requests correctly
