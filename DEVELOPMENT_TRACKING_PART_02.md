- AlertManager for threshold monitoring
- MetricsCollector base class
- NetworkMetricsPanel for visualization

**File Paths:**
- /src/monitoring/collectors/NetworkMetricsCollector.ts
- /src/core/network/NetworkTransport.ts (monitored)
- /src/monitoring/dashboard/components/NetworkMetricsPanel.tsx (visualization)

**Next Priority Task:**
Implement network transport layer error recovery and resilience mechanisms.

Expected completion time: 2 days

### 2024-03-19: Network Error Recovery Implementation

Implemented comprehensive error recovery and resilience mechanisms for the network transport layer.

**Core Components Implemented:**
- NetworkErrorRecovery class with circuit breaker pattern
- Exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Message timeout tracking and retry management
- Connection failure tracking per node
- Queue size limiting for pending messages

**Key Features:**
- Circuit breaker with three states (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN)
- Configurable retry policies with exponential backoff
- Automatic message retry with timeout detection
- Connection health monitoring
- Failure threshold tracking
- Queue size management
- Type-safe error handling

**Integration Points:**
- NetworkTransport for message sending
- Event system for error notifications
- Monitoring system for metrics
- Alert system for circuit breaker state changes

**File Paths:**
- /src/core/network/NetworkErrorRecovery.ts
- /src/core/network/NetworkTransport.ts (integrated)
- /src/core/network/types.ts (used)

**Next Priority Task:**
Implement integration tests for error recovery mechanisms and verify resilience under various failure scenarios.

Expected completion time: 2 days

   - Implement Merkle Tree verification
   - Add Gossip Protocol for state dissemination

2. **Consistency Protocols**
   - Two-Phase Commit for critical transactions
   - Paxos/Raft consensus for distributed state
   - Optimistic concurrency control
   - Read-repair mechanisms
   - Anti-entropy protocols

3. **Monitoring and Verification**
   - Distributed tracing with Jaeger
   - Prometheus metrics for consistency SLAs
   - Automated invariant checking
   - State transition validation
   - Consistency level monitoring

4. **Failure Recovery**
   - Snapshot isolation mechanisms
   - Write-ahead logging
   - State reconstruction protocols
   - Automated leader election
   - Partition tolerance strategies

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Read-your-writes consistency
   - Session guarantees
   - Causally consistent reads
   - Bounded staleness controls
   - Adaptive consistency levels

### Known Issues and Technical Debt
1. Performance Optimization Needed:
   - Achievement calculations for large player bases
   - Tournament bracket generation for large tournaments
   - Reward preview loading
   - WebGL context management
   - Achievement notification queuing (rate limiting)

2. Implementation Gaps:
   - Achievement caching system
   - TypeScript configurations standardization
   - Security vulnerability fixes
   - Documentation updates for new features

3. Asset Requirements:
   - Screenshots for all required device sizes
   - App store promotional materials
   - Promotional videos

4. App Store Requirements:
   - Privacy policy URL update
   - App preview videos approval
   - Marketing copy localization

5. **Context Assurance Gaps**:
   - Vector clock implementation needed
   - CRDT integration pending
   - Consensus protocol selection
   - State verification coverage
   - Cross-region consistency
