### 2024-07-01: QR Code/Geolocation Venue Check-In UI Integration

Added a QR code and geolocation-based check-in flow to the venue check-in system. Users can now check in at venues by scanning a QR code and verifying their location. The UI is integrated and tested, but backend API validation for QR/geolocation should be reviewed for completeness.

**Core Components Implemented:**
- Venue check-in system UI extension (QR/geolocation dialog)
- QRCodeScanner integration
- Geolocation capture and API call

**File Paths:**
- /src/dojopool/frontend/components/venues/[VENUE]CheckInSystem.tsx

Expected completion time: 1 day

### 2024-07-01: Real-Time Tracking UI – RealTimeGameView Component

Created the RealTimeGameView component, which integrates GameTracker and ShotTracker to provide a unified real-time tracking UI. The component subscribes to live game state via WebSocket, visualizes scores, fouls, current player, shot clock, and live shot tracking. This forms the foundation for the real-time game experience and is ready for further AI referee and admin view integration.

**Core Components Implemented:**
- RealTimeGameView (unified real-time tracking UI)
- GameTracker (WebSocket subscription)
- ShotTracker (live shot visualization)

**File Paths:**
- /src/features/game/RealTimeGameView.tsx
