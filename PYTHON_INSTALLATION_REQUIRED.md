# Python Installation Required for Dependency Installation & Audit

## Current Issue
Python is not properly installed or configured on this system. The following commands from the issue description cannot be executed:

```powershell
# 1. Install project dependencies from your requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Install and run the security audit tool
pip install pip-audit && pip-audit
```

## Required Actions Before Proceeding

### 1. Install Python
- Download Python from https://python.org/downloads/
- During installation, ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked
- Restart WebStorm after installation

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
Once Python is installed, run these commands in WebStorm's terminal:

```powershell
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Verify activation (should show (venv) in prompt)
```

### 3. Install Dependencies and Run Audit
After virtual environment is active:

```powershell
# Install project dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install and run security audit tool
pip install pip-audit && pip-audit
```

## Project Dependencies (from requirements.txt)
- flask>=3.1.0
- flask-login>=0.6.3
- flask-sqlalchemy>=3.1.1
- psycopg2-binary>=2.9.10
- flask-socketio>=5.4.1

2. Restart WebStorm
3. Run the commands above in WebStorm's terminal
4. Paste the complete pip-audit output for vulnerability analysis

## Status
- [ ] Python installed and in PATH
- [ ] Virtual environment created
- [ ] Dependencies installed
