Based on the code snippets and logs you've provided, it seems you're encountering a couple of issues:

1. **Redirect Loop in Your Application**:
   - The logs indicate that your application is repeatedly redirecting to HTTPS, which may be causing a redirect loop.
   - This is evidenced by the repeated 301 redirects when accessing the `/game` endpoint.

2. **Ball Detection Adjustments in OpenCV**:
   - You've made changes to your ball detection algorithm, switching to adaptive thresholding and Hough Circle detection.
   - There might be issues with the implementation that need attention.

Let's address each issue step by step.

## **1. Resolving the Redirect Loop**

### **Issue Analysis**

- **Logs Indicating Redirect Loop**:
  ```
  INFO:__main__:Redirecting to HTTPS: https://your-app-url/game
  "GET /game HTTP/1.1" 301
  ```
  - The `301` status code means a permanent redirect.
  - If your application keeps redirecting `/game` to HTTPS, but the request doesn't become secure, it will keep redirecting indefinitely.

### **Possible Causes**

- **Incorrect `before_request` Logic**:
  - The function that enforces HTTPS redirection might be misconfigured, causing it to redirect even when the request is already secure.

### **Suggested Solution**

**Review and Modify Your `before_request` Function:**

```python
@app.before_request
def before_request():
    # Check if the request is secure or if it's running on localhost
    if request.is_secure or request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Proto', 'http') == 'https':
        return  # Request is secure; no action needed

    # Skip redirection for OAuth callbacks to prevent interference with OAuth flow
    if request.path.startswith('/auth/'):
        return

    # Redirect to HTTPS
    url = request.url.replace('http://', 'https://', 1)
    return redirect(url, code=301)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Check for HTTPS Correctly**:
  - `request.is_secure` might not always detect HTTPS correctly, especially behind certain proxies or platforms.
  - Checking `X-Forwarded-Proto` header is a reliable way to determine if the original request was HTTPS.

- **Prevent Redirect Loop**:
  - Ensure that once the request is on HTTPS, it doesn't get redirected again.
  - The condition should allow secure requests to proceed without redirection.

- **Exclude OAuth Paths**:
  - Continue to exclude OAuth callback paths from redirection if necessary.

**Additional Steps:**

- **Test the Application**:
  - After making changes, test accessing `/game` to see if the redirect loop is resolved.
  - Use an incognito window to avoid cached redirects.

- **Logging**:
  - Add logging to `before_request` to monitor the flow:
    ```python
    logger.debug(f"Request URL: {request.url}, Secure: {request.is_secure}, X-Forwarded-Proto: {request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Proto')}")
    ```

## **2. Reviewing Ball Detection Code in OpenCV**

### **Code Changes Provided**

```diff
-2
+1
    self.current_game_stats = {}
    self.ball_tracker = cv2.TrackerCSRT_create()
    self.ball_bbox = None
    self.previous_ball_positions = []
```

```diff
-34
+22
# Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise

    # Use adaptive thresholding to handle varying lighting conditions
    thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(
        blurred, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, 
        cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, 11, 2
    )

    # Use Hough Circle detection for more reliable ball detection
    circles = cv2.HoughCircles(
        blurred,
        cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT,
        dp=1,
```

### **Issue Analysis**

- **Switching Detection Methods**:
  - You are changing from one tracking method (`cv2.TrackerCSRT_create`) to using Hough Circle detection.
- **Potential Issues**:
  - Incorrect parameters or missing steps in image preprocessing might lead to detection failures.

### **Suggested Solution**

**Review the Ball Detection Implementation:**

1. **Ensure Proper Preprocessing**:

   - **Convert to Grayscale**:
     ```python
     gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
     ```

   - **Apply Gaussian Blur**:
     ```python
     blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (9, 9), 2)
     ```

2. **Adaptive Thresholding**:

   - Make sure the syntax is correct and the parentheses are properly closed.
     ```python
     thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(
         blurred, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C, 
         cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, 11, 2
     )
     ```

3. **Hough Circle Detection**:

   - Complete the function call with necessary parameters:
     ```python
     circles = cv2.HoughCircles(
         blurred,
         cv2.HOUGH_GRADIENT,
         dp=1.2,
         minDist=30,
         param1=50,
         param2=30,
         minRadius=5,
         maxRadius=30
     )
     ```

   - **Parameters Explanation**:
     - `dp`: Inverse ratio of the accumulator resolution to the image resolution.
     - `minDist`: Minimum distance between detected centers.
     - `param1`: Higher threshold for the Canny edge detector.
     - `param2`: Accumulator threshold for the circle centers at the detection stage.
     - `minRadius` and `maxRadius`: Minimum and maximum radius of circles to detect.

4. **Check for NoneType Errors**:

   - Ensure that `circles` is checked before using:
     ```python
     if circles is not None:
         circles = np.uint16(np.around(circles))
         for i in circles[0, :]:
             center = (i[0], i[1])
             radius = i[2]
             # Draw circle center
             cv2.circle(frame, center, 1, (0, 100, 100), 3)
             # Draw circle outline
             cv2.circle(frame, center, radius, (255, 0, 255), 3)
     ```

5. **Visualization for Debugging**:

   - Display intermediate steps to verify each stage:
     ```python
     cv2.imshow('Blurred', blurred)
     cv2.imshow('Thresholded', thresh)
     cv2.imshow('Detected Circles', frame)
     cv2.waitKey(1)
     ```

6. **Adjust Parameters as Needed**:

   - Depending on lighting conditions and ball appearance, you may need to tweak the parameters for `GaussianBlur`, `adaptiveThreshold`, and `HoughCircles`.

### **Additional Tips**

- **Consistent Indentation and Syntax**:
  - Ensure all code blocks are correctly indented and that all parentheses/brackets are properly closed.

- **Import Necessary Libraries**:
  - Ensure you have imported `numpy` as `np` if you're using `np.uint16` and `np.around`.

- **Resource Management**:
  - Release video capture and destroy all windows when done:
    ```python
    cap.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
    ```

## **3. General Recommendations**

- **Test Incrementally**:
  - Make one change at a time and test it thoroughly before proceeding to the next.
  - This helps isolate issues and understand the impact of each change.

- **Use Logging Extensively**:
  - Implement logging at key points to monitor variable values and program flow.
  - For example:
    ```python
    logger.debug(f"Circles detected: {circles}")
    ```

- **Exception Handling**:
  - Wrap code blocks that may throw exceptions in try-except blocks to prevent crashes and provide meaningful error messages.

## **4. Next Steps**

1. **Apply the Suggested Changes**:
   - Update your `before_request` function to resolve the redirect loop.
   - Adjust your OpenCV ball detection code as outlined.

2. **Test the Application**:
   - Verify that the redirect loop is fixed by accessing `/game` and ensuring it loads correctly.
   - Test the ball detection to see if the pool balls are being detected accurately.

3. **Monitor Logs**:
   - Keep an eye on your application's logs for any errors or warnings that can provide further insight.

4. **Seek Further Assistance if Needed**:
   - If issues persist, consider sharing specific error messages or stack traces (excluding any sensitive information) for more targeted support.
